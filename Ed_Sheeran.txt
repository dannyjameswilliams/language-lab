The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm


I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve


When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hi


Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know tha


I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He s


When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we


She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, 


Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

You're a mystery
I've travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmm

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you


I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
Let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into yo


Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, well that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the ph


I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't (hhh)  with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reloa


White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh

Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
I see fire
And I see fire bu


We are, we are, we are

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)

L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more

Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll 


Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)

I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the


(One, two)

Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I


Nah nah nah nah nah

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says "Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't


You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too


Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me to


I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were 


Well get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it

And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street

In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona

Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street

In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Oh, Barcelona
So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona

Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
We'll dance around La Sagrada Familia (Barcelona)
Drinking Sangría
Mi niña, te amo mi cariño (Barcelona)
Mamacita, rica
Sí tú, te adoro, señorita (Barcelona)
Nosotros, vivir la vida
Come on, let's be free in Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
Come on and dance with me in Barcelona
Drinking Sangría
I just want to be in Barcelona
Mamacita, rica
Feel that summer breeze in Barcelona
Los otros, viva 


Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love

Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

One, two, three, four

Settle down with me
Cover me up, cuddle me in
Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms

And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love

Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows
So hold me in your arms
Oh no

My heart’s against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love


Yeah, I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're f


Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels"

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend ya
And I keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've d


I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone


She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know

But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go

Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break a


You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that

I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You 


Bibia be ye ye

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye

I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)

Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's getting older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you

Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I hadn't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right

Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failure
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create"
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has 


Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us

And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop

And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now? (And I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover?
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)

For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For 


It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh

SING!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
LOUDER!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
SING!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh

SING!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
LOUDER!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
SING!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

SING!
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
LOUDER! Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
SING!
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
LOUDER! Oh-oh


I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and a somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me thе shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And whеn they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (Oh, no)
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then 


Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)

I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London

Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, "That's just the way things go"
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)
So take me back to Lo


Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a frie


I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me 


Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

And my father told me "son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing

Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love

And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when

And my father told me "son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing

Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love

And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And all my brother and my sisters
And my father and all of my family
Rise from 


I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another "like you"
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything’s great, not everything’s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Because, if I was gonna go somewhere
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (wo-oahh)
And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're 


I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now

Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, "Everything that happens is from now on"
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now

Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No, I'll take it back now

Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now

Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake
But the other 10 percent, it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower
You'll never know where you will g


My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you

With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

Baby, the best part of me is you (Whoa)
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh)
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Oh,


You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life

I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right

You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right

You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right

You were just a small bump unborn
Just four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there



I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh won't you leave me now?

Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and Love will go)
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been living on the road, Nina
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
(Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and Love will go)
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been living on the road, Nina
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh


I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I’ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fe


It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh, I know
And oh, I know
And oh
I 


Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true, I kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But  it
I won't be changing the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot?
I think not

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change 
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I d


I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
Should I, Should I?

Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?

Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be dru


I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go

"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go

"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack
Intends to show love
I don’t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days, I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that
Things change, but for now I'll leave town
With a backpack on my shoulder

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll


I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance," hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my

I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Prr)
But they ain't got nothing on you (Ah, ah)
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones Con Flow)

Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, ah
Desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
A besarno' lo' do', hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
Parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh (Yo'; ¡wuf!)
Pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa (Ey; wuh)
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar

I was rolling up something with you (¡Wuh!)
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Prr)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

Look, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the Rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? 'Cause that's suttin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah

I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
Want to be your man
"Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Damn¨

It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight, hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today, hold on

So live life like you’re giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on 


When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Just make it rain
Make it rain

Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change

Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain


Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul

I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say

Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me

Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me

Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby

I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you that can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
Baby, I can't wait, in love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now

Hey, baby, we can dance slowly (Hey)
My, darlin', I'll be all you need, you need (Oh)
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me (Babe)

Love, on me, o-o-on me (On me)
Hey baby, we can dance slowly (Slow)
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me (On me)
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whatever you need (Need)
So put it all on me

I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch

Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in

She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is making you age
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back
She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn

She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

Now an angel will die, covered in white
With closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time now, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

Little lady, you're trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police in
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, "Who you working for?"
He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
He's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, "Where you been, bitch? I wanna know"
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's something new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point, your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday

And we're all under the upper hand
And going mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
And fly, fly
For angels to fly
To


I said, oi, you, are you gonna bang doe?
No, I want some fucking Nando's
Wanna eat up with chicken and chips
Everyone knows I freestyle like this
When I freestyle on the beat about chicken
You know it's finger lickin'
And now I'm gonna pass it over to Example now
He's gonna freestyle and he's gonna show you how

Chicken, chicken wings
They're my favourite things and I love to sing
I say chicken, chicken wings
If you give me them I will eat them tings

Yo, and we eat chicken for free
Cause he's got a black card you see
He made a song about chicken from Nando's
And are you gonna bang yo?
Yes please I want some chicken right now
Please I want to put it in my stomach yes
It tastes so good I wanna eat the chicken
With the fucking breasts and the wings
And the thighs and the chips and the...

And all them things that are nice
Nando's from me, fat chance I gotta black card
If you come to me and ask for chicken you'll get a fat scar
In your left cheek I eat Nando's every week
Sometime on a Tuesday, sometime on a Thursday (yo)
I get free drinks, refillable even when I'm thirsty
On a Thursday I eat chicken in the worst ways

Yeah, I said we are on tour, saw him
I'm like get out the store, yo!
Cause you are a whore
Eat Nando's for free everyday on tour, yo!
And it's a par, I ate Nando's from your car
Can't freestyle cause you'll see me starve
I slap you in the face cause like I'm like Febreeze ya!

Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
I eat chicken off the floor
I eat chicken off the bone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken off the floor
Chicken off the sky
Chicken off the bone
I eat chicken off the bone

I love Nando's more than your mum does
More than your mum does
Nando's (I say oh)
I love Nando's
My tongue is on fire
I wanna say Elliot (yes Ed?)
Nando's I desire (I'll give it to you anytime you want babe)
I want some free Nando's from your black card

You ain't getting in my wallet
Ain't getting in my wallet
I'm on it, I'm on it (I wanna take your black card)
You ain't getting my wallet

Cause I need them pounds every time I go there to eat my food
And you're so fucking rude you don't fucking buy it for me
So I want Nandos for free
And you look like you put your fingers in electricity sockets
To get your hair up like this

You're never touching my card, this is my card
You're never touching my card, this is my card
You come to me, play your guitar
Step to me hard, you ain't getting my card star

I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's (right now)


Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good


It's such a beautiful night, to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talking about love and life
Oh how lucky am I, when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way, to spend a moment or two
To be lying awake, and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I got to do
To be making a change, now the moment of truth

Why I’m feeling so nervous?
Things are going so perfect
Now I know that it’s worth it
To spend forever with you

So I count to three, and get down on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right
So I ask you, tonight, will you marry me?
Just say yes
It's one word, one love, one life

A gentle touch of the hand, fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh I was caught unaware
Oh so many times, I gazed in both of her eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of a life
Some will reappear, burning auburn and red
I'll chest the pill, bring us home to bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
What a wonderful way, to fall in deeper in with you

Why was I feeling nervous?
When things were going so perfect
Well, now I know that it’s worth it
To spend forever with you

So I count to three, and get down on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right
So I ask you, tonight, will you marry me?
Just say yes
It's one word, one love, one life
One life
One life

Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh you and I
Some things were just meant to be
Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh you and I
Some things were just meant to be
Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh you and I
Some things were just meant to be
Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh you and I

I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lines, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
They showed me the locked doors I find another use of key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner
I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue, and
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngen
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I wish my family and friends, they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh
And I wish I'd never run through
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, "Fuck you"
I wish I was home more
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more
People that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for
And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?
Oh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressing 'cause
Every day this cocaine gets the best of us
Usin' my balance on razor blades
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat coat
Mum sayin', "Don't smoke," no, I don't listen, I got
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign
Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine
Shit quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me, "Work hard and you can never be shit"
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Set back here reminiscing '


Another day, another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated
Another mind, another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Another tear, another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated

Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
I miss you and I wish you'd stay

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Touch down
Like a seven four seven
We'll stay out


He rode through the streets of the city
Down from his hill on high
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobble
He rode to a woman's sigh
For she was his secret treasure
She was his shame and his bliss
And a chain and a keep are nothing
Compared to a woman's kiss

For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm
For hands of gold are always co


We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?
And heaven knows, no one wants it to

So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

We're not friends, we could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
They'll never know what we've been through

So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

But then again, if we're not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again, if we're not friends
There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why

Friends should sleep in other beds
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
And I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you do
Oh, my frien


Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now?"
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "Play my shit"
And they gon' sing like this

Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo)
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world

Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded (Gettin' faded)
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

Mmm, I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make you seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She was, she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes

Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, st


This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on, to rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration, hip-hip-hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
It's so still, the fire's barely fighting the cold alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it or leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us or even erase us
The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me

Well, I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost on me


Star sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinkin’ 'bout her

And her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
’Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That’s the way to break my—

First love never dies
Guess I’ll see you in another life
12 years down the line
There's just one thing I remember

Her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don’t know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else’s arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my—

That's the—
That's the—
That's the—
Did I, did I?
That's the—
That's th


I thought it'd feel different playin' Wembley
Eighty thousand singin' with me
It's what I've been chasin' 'cause this is the dream
When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we started talking the way that we do

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn
I still feel the first fight, and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times
Mmm, mmm

The greatest thing that I have achieved
Was four little words, down on one knee
You said, "Darling, are you jokin'?", and I just said, "Please"

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first look in your eyes when I said "I love you"
I can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
I can't wait to make a million more first times
Mmm, mmm

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, first night, first song that made you cry
First dance in moonlight in your parents' garden
I can't wait to see everything that's yet to be
Our first child and t


My mind is a warrior, my heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the color of red like a sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart, not a follower, we're not done yet now

I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
Oh, I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down, down

My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest against
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again

I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
Oh, I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down

Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the grou


Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
I waited most my life for somethin' real (You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Jump into the crowd, leave your hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no nothin'
Gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in the cloud, babe
Baby, I got that feel (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why you're doin' this to me
I tried to tell 'em not to do it this loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the rivals
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
I waited most my life for somethin' real
(You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Used to be Playboy heartbreaker
But for you, I'll travel a thousand acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers (Alright)
One day, we'll get married in Las Vegas (Nah)
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin (Alright)
This love give you protein and vitamin (Yeah)
See you wigglin', jigglin' (Mmm)
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon? (One)
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I ever really seen
And you give me this feel if you know what I mean

Baby, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Feels, yeah
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
I waited most my life for somethin' rea


How was I to know? It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would givе you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the bеst in me

You’re not her, though I try to see you differently
I tow the line, you see, I’m searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes, and I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you

She was mine
I was hers and all that’s in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you

Don’t drop me in, it’s not my turn
If you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scarred and left me, like a sunburn
Don’t drop me in, it’s not my turn
And if you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scar and leave me, like a sunburn

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you


I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You’ll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you’ll be floating away

And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss of bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make-up
I’ll never trust you again
You can just be a friend

And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes

Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact is I
I’m on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I’m-
I’m drowning in the oceans you made

When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes

I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now I have a child, I know one day that you will do it

Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again
Feelin' low, serotonin known better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me

Timе stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, lifе is changin' tides

I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way

Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote, "The princess and the face scar"
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tides
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will

If we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird

If we take a walkout, in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next to you
Come inside for a little homemade tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least you're next to me
And if I wake up, you say it's late love, get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird

And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You make me scream, and then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird
My little bird

This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, ooh

And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall, now

You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing

And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall, now

And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall, down to earth
Take me back, for

This is start of something beautiful

Ayy, I waited for you all day

I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time

I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home (Yeah)
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I want all of your love, your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I just want your, I just want your time)

You know you're my baby (You know you're my baby)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy
Why you gotta mess with my mind?
You know you're my baby (You know you're, oh)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy, you know, you know

I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (Yeah, I want, yeah, I want your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (Time, time)

And I love, and I love, and I love you
Yeah, I love, and I love, and I love you
And I love, and I love, and I love you
But I want your t


She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off of last night's whiskey and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke

You can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep

Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

'Cause I love the way you wake me up
And for goodness sake, will my love not be enough?

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand

No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely

Another night, another club
Another room, another one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
I don't know why, you're not enough

No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
'Cause maybe you could just be the one, ayy

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark

Another night, another day
Been thinking 'bout it wide awake
I never thought I'd be alone
While everybody blowing up my phone
Don't trust no one, no, so don't want to get close
I get mine, I walk away

No lie, yeah, my mama always told me to be a bad girl
Never let anybody get in the way of what I'm trying to do now
This ain't man's world, thank you next, I'ma go my own way
Sometimes being solo is the way to go
When you need to figure shit out
And if I want you boy, I'ma tell you so
'Cause I'm the one in control, yeah

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark

No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Yuh), no lo-lo-love for the lonely (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely (Oh, yeah)

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me, yeah
My love is a flickering candle (Flickering candle, yeah), in the dark

No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Yuh), no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Love for the lonely), no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark

And I will try to find someone to hold me (Mhm)

Born with a heart
That could ache more than beat
The mind of the killer
The soul of the meek
Born aimless and angry
Ran hard from the day
Left love at the crossroad
Into a man that I hate

Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I drop to my knees?
Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?

King of the kings, do you feel any pain?

I fight for the hope
That blood has a face
To give me a kiss
For the faith that I wait
Flock with no shepherd
Is a vulnerable game
I can live without heart, without love
But I do need a name

Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I drop to my knees?
Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?

King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?

This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two

And my lungs hurt, and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city nev


I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I've got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best, and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat

'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays and

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All


Oh yeah, we've been in the rain
Been on the rocks, but we found our way
We've ordered pizza to an aeroplane
Slept on the beach like we were castaways
We've been in the storm
Been to an Irish bar in central Rome
Driven to hospitals with broken bones
We've shared a toothbrush and shared our home
We've seen the moon reflect on the rollin' tide
Been up at 5AM, watchin' the sunrise
Becausе the world looks better whеn I'm by your side
Oh I, oh I, oh I

When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life

We've been on the road
We've watched the blossom fall to Earth like snow
Fumbled in cubicles in Tokyo
And been to funerals in rented clothes
Mmm, we drank your father's whiskey when your grandma died
You brought me to the morning through my darkest night
Yeah, the world hurts less when I'm by your side
Oh I, oh I, oh I

When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life

Head first, collidin'
Dreamers collidin'
Universe collidin'
Your love let the light in
Head first, collidin'
Dreamers collidin'
Universe collidin'

We made love in the sky
Overslept and missed the Northern Lights
You lost your wedding ring, but I didn’t mind
‘Cause I got 


If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?
We'll see the same sky tonight
But the stars are out of place
You'll never know the weight of my heart
Every time I leave you, babe

It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again

I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life

Oh, I could never tell you, "LY"
Or put in words your finest traits
The darkest green and hazel eyes
And yet I can't describe the shade
You are all this heart of mine
And there you will remain
You'll never know the weight of my
Decisions when I leave your smiling face

It's hard to understand it
But I'll see you again

Oh, I, I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life

It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again

I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life

If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Waking up, midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said

So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke

Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be touch and go

It's not enough, to say I want ya
Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt
I had have just been questioning it

If I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke

Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be

All of my bones, they scream I'm right
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling my soul would heal

If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the wrong
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, how long
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, ho


Ooh, ooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh now now

Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room
Now this bar has closed it's doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?
Or maybe we should take a ride through the night
And sing along to every song that's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn
Oh no no, the sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM
So DJ, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new love
In New York

Yesterday, gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast
And you don't know where to begin
Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know
So DJ, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new life
In New York

And every song that plays
Is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying maybe that's
A waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight
In New York

It's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
And we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything that y


It's been a while since we've been alone
To turn off the world and the telephone
I need to tell you you're beautiful
'Cause it's been a while and I apologize
I just get caught up in the ratrace I'm runnin'
Chasin' a moment, I'm hoping is comin'
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes

Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darling, that dress reminds
Me of the first time

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion

It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves, and I apologize
Sometimes you're sad and you tell me it's nothin'
And I brush it off because there's always somethin'
But I need to change my perspective
And prioritize-ize

'Cause one thing I know, it's this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
Wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion



I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I’d never leave her
But now I’m ready to go
And strange as it seems
She’s endless to me
She’s just like paperwork
But harder to read

Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn’t sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me for dear life
And blocking my way

Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
"Won’t you stay?" She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I’ll stay, anyway
Cause she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myse


Met her smoking a cigarette
In  a toilet cubicle
Red  dress, tattooed chest
She's beautiful
This ain't the time or place to start a future
But  darling I don't care
Broken  hearts can find a love
To make them whole anywhere

Oh  darling, here we go again
We are only man or woman
And we all make mistakes
Don't you know we're only human
It's  what our hardships say
And when I heard those words and knew them
I could feel your pain
Cause I have felt the same, oh

She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?

She told about her mum and dad
And they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchanging names
We're two souls intertwined
We have both got it wrong
From time to time and let that go
With each other, hand in hand
As we mend broken souls

Darling, here we go again
We are only blood and bones
That cover beating hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones
But we know who we are
I could put you back together
When you come apart
We should make a start now

She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in your eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?

And it feels like we felt serenity
And some things are not what they seem
My love, right now it's only you and me

She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in your eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?



Another human cloud to bring you down when you blew the last away
And bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown, but for me, they look the same
Sometimes, it can get all too much for me
And that's why the photograph gets burned, throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy

Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Another "I, me, mine" to blur the lines between love and then heartbreak
Oh, it's a lonely life thinkin' you're right and always shiftin' blame
And every time it's getting more and more ugly
And that's why the photograph gets burned, throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy

Don't let them tell you "Keep it all inside"
I know the winds have got to change

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And it seems like time can be so much more than a wake-up call
And live real life
Every day is a chance that we can start over, read my mind
There'll be ups and downs, but it won't change a thing between you and I
There's one thing I can't change

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't stop the rain, yeah, can't stop the rain, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't stop the rain, can't stop the rain (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't stop the rain (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know you can't stop th


Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
'Cause now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me stranded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Oh, tell me, babe, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't've let you go

Oh, I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind

Could I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures?
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt
On a late night, coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine, smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines, hey

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah

And now I'm sitting on a night bus, flicking through my iPod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to UNI
People see right through me, but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, I'm gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah

When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate who wants to be my duvet, yeah

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's no


Smoke alarm went off at nine
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note "I'll be back in 5"
Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey

I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved

I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words to a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey

I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?

You were loved before you had arrived
And every day that love just multiplies
Daddy made your bed and your lullaby
And Mumma made the mobile in the sky
And loving you is easy
But life will not always be
Fall into the world of your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong

Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the sandman
And though there's rain outside, you'll bе warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my lovе
Hanging out with the sandman

Chocolate-covered roof and candy cars
Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
Marshmallow books and strawberries
Snowmen made of ice cream
Over the flower fields, we'll fly
We'll count the fish in the sky
Honeybees and birds sing your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong

Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the sandman
And though there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hanging out with the sandman

Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the sandman
And though there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hanging out with the sandman

We're hanging out with the sandman
We're hanging out with the sandman
We'r


A lifetime startin' to feel like
It's fallin' short of the mark
But it's all that we got
Every teardrop, every wrong turn
Made the moment we found
And it's comin' around, around, around, around, around

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothin' but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

The shadows cling to the ceiling
And fracture the light
That lands in our eyes
Every moment changes the whole view
And just when it ends
I feel it again, again, again, again, again

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothin' but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Stay here and be right now
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Just stay here and be right now

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out

Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention as she makes an entrance?
Said I had a tendency to finish off a sentence
Oh well, she’s a local girl
No make-up cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
It's like the fast food, I’ll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she’s all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She’s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man

I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

And we’ve got that love in us and we're the drink killers
We’re gonna dance all night to the floor fillers
If we talk outside, say "Hey what's new?"
I don’t really dance so I’ll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight? Tell me if that’s alright
I don’t wanna be here, I’m not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don’t mind sharing
She said I wanna take off what you’re wearing



She’s like the fast food, I’ll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she’s all I need

Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else

Across the sea by the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I long to be, in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from, she's waiting for me

So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me

I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me "son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea"

And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats f


I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

We're at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, I don't care
I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, yeah

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, ye


One, two, three

Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you squeeze me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up, if we go to Brighton I'll
Take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up, and if you feel too frightened I'll
Make things disappear, dear

Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you

I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you

Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you breathe me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated;
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been jaded, and this love's too overrated;
See what's going on

And darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you

I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you

Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road

'Cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left too, I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you
And I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left me too, I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you,


I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew your heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars, if it helps you sleep

And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart, melt me down
It's too cold in this town
Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one to help me get to sleep

And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

It's only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
Only been one night of love
Maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world 


I am a poor, wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And there's no sickness, toil, or danger
In that bright land to which I go

And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home now

Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah (Mmmm)
Hey ay ay yeah (Oooh)
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah

And I know dark clouds, will gather me
And I know my way is rough and steep
And the beautiful fields that lie just beyond me
And I know my needs are rough and steep

And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home now

'Cause I am a poor, wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And there's no sickness, toil, or danger
In that bright land to which I go

And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan

I didn't mean to break your heart, I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight?
I wish I never called you up, and nobody told me
And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
And won't you just hold me tonight?

And I will stop trying to fall in love again, and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you are the only one for me, yeah yeah

Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want

I never meant to sleep around, I was just lonely
And you did the same, again and again and again, whoa I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight

And I will stop trying to fall in love again, and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you are the only one for me, yeah yeah

Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want

When I see my future, it is with you
And we’ll get there
And I want my children to be with you
And we’ll get there

Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want

Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
Behind my


You give me life and a loss of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight, tight enough to know
That you are mine, I'd never let you go

And it's you I miss
And it's you I miss

So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

And you speak to me behind your darkened stare
And you let me be as if I wasn't there

It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

It's you I miss
And it's you I miss, oh-oh

So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue

So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, 


Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heart beat in my mind
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

I'm filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you for all of the summer
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world, then, please, ask your mother

I cannot hold your hand to watch you go
Oh, I am a liar, as you might know

I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need your smile and your kiss

'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...

Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmmmm
Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmm

I see your voice
And from my window
When it is late at night it'll show me your shadow
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world and, please, ask your mother
Now, ah-oh-ah-oh

I cannot hold your hand, to watch you go
Oh, I'm a liar, as you might know

I need you now
I need your touch and your lips

And I've noticed lately, I need you, maybe

'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...

She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5:01 like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed and I'm way too tired
Hoodie still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you

When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula 1
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

And it's cold outside again
And we're still so high

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you

And it feels like I'm flying
And it feels like

We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York, that is where I will take ya
Paris, Rome, to Rio, passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on


You and I
Two of a mind
This love's, one of a kind
You and I
We’re drifting
Over the edge

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

You and I
We’re learning to speak
With kisses on cheeks
You and I
We’re lifted
Over the edge

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you


I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close

5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed?
It's D-E-V to the Zed
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll
Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying
Cause I got too much to stay awake for
To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line
Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately

I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those
That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy
Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be
On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro
Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die)

Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information
And then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets
At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like, "Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"
What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock
And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake

I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be



The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (Everybody, sing it loud)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (VMAs, sing it loud, hey)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new (Uzi)
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, come on be my baby
Come on, I can't wait for long
You know I love your body but I hate that you a star
No, I do not really need you 'cause you know I ball
(I'm in love with your body)
Yeah, I'm in love with the shape of you
No, it do not matter if you're skinny or you're tall
If you're thicker than a snicker or you're small
Get the picture when I kiss you
Diamonds gleaming, they be shining on my wrist (My wrist)
And I don't know why they be always acting bitter (I don't know)
'Cause they know that I'm the one that's gonna get her


I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "I am not afraid to die."
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah


Hmm, let me go
To see my family
Please, Father, let me go
As my mother sleeps

I don't know about James bond
But round here nobody lives twice
When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye
Cause only a judge can give you life
This is my advice
Trust me, I nearly lost my life
3 weeks after I got this ride
Pissed like I had way too much wine
Wished I didn't get one
Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set
Even though I didn't have a set one
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination
Then I was off to the next one
20 minutes later I was on the M1
Tired, but I kept on going
Fell asleep without even knowing
No motion in my face
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going
Woke up, lorry, flash
Panic, break, skid, crash
Skidded more, bang, smash
Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch
I was in so much pain
Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini
When I was still on the first lane
Baffled, didn't even know my name
Fainted, too much shock in my brain
Surrounded by paramedics and feds
Trying to get up but fainted again

See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out
Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared
And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go

To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please, Father, let me go
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps

Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open
I could hear voices and my phone ringing
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning
One of the worst situations I've been in
I could hear all of the angels singing
But when they stopped humming
My brain turned on, started running
Still in pain, but it started numbing
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning
I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming
But I was left with a permanent problem
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly)
Ever so cunning
6 weeks later, jogging and running
I used the first aid kit like a drum set
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes
You can't afford to let one in
Never done tunes for a while
The pipeline was blocked
So I learned and done a bit of plumbing
They say tomorrow never dies
But they forgot to tell you, you can
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam
You can try beg for another
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show
Thinking "I just wanna see my brother"
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up


To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while


Full lyrics will be available upon release, stay tuned!

Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free
Long before you broke my heart
Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free



Shock, horror, I’m down, lost, you’re not around
There’s a lump in my chest that sends cold through my head, and
My mind shuts sound out
I’m on auto-pilot, and my tongue's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down, next to you and me

I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you and I miss you

These words mean nothing to me
I’m just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching, constrict and suffocating
My mind is racing with the picture I’m painting
And my belly’s sick to its stomach
When I remember all the times he was with you when you laid it down
When you lay down next to me

I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you, more than I let on
I kissed you far too long
I’ll let go as soon as you do
See I know we’re not through

I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you and I miss you

I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, yo


Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When I’m next to you

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we land

It’s been this way since we were young
We’ll fight and then make up
I’ll breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we land

Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s f


Hey, can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know, hmm

I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh

I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you "Nan can I go out?"
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh

It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you

There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me

I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embr


Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did
Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did
Your candle burned out lon


The rain won't stop falling
It's harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
Is if you want me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call

We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework, dodging classes
To set off fire alarms

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call

We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I

If you need me when you call
What I need to know

Come ye masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it’s your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
As the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young people’s blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

And you’ve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, you ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I’m young
You might say I’m unlearned
But there’s one thing I know
Though I’m younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could?
Well, I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
And I'll follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I’ll watch as you’re lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I’ll stand over your grave
To make sure that you’re dead

Cool



Hi, my name is Jme
There was a time when radio played me
'Cause my music came from my heart
It was real to me, but now it's a par
I'm here struggling, keeping it real
While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think
"Jme just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill"
The reason I started making music is the exact same
Reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all of that for this
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is
I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different?
Look at me, determined, man on a mission
My music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'mma do this

I never had a playlist in my heart
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark?

Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist)
How much will you pay me though
If this song's not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Thank God for night clubs and the raves
'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down
But cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth
You won't hear me on the radio
But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof
Why is that? What's going on there?
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

I never had a playlist in my heart
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark?

Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist)
How much will you pay me though
If this song's not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers, written by the pile
So won't you hear me out?
Never feel it from the bass line, feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub
So won't you hear me out?

I never had a playlist in my heart
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark?

Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist)
How much will you pay me though
If this song's not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist)
How much will you pay me though
If this song's not a hit on the


I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love

And we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, you rubbing on it, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right, gangster wife
Louis rags, he sweat it out, he sweat it out, I'm with that
Boy, I'm drinking, now I'm on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
Big body just graining on that wood-wood-wood-wood-woooood

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love

Now we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

I don't know much about love but I - know I've been shot by you
I don't know much about Algebra but I know 1+1 is two
Cause we ain't got nothing without love
And baby you got enough for the both of us

Cause we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, lo


I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Maybe there's a god above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You said I took the name in vain
Well, I never really knew that name
But if I did, what really is it to you?
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not some victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Ha

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams

I'm walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines, what's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs, to know I'm still alive and I walk alone
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams

I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevar


So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skys from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The sam


The thoughts I have could be clear ones, they can seem vivid
The goals I reach are not near ones, the further the limit
I block her out so when I'm looking though my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum
It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots
What's better than thinking about the ones you love?
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm on the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up
No one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is, I wasn't so I'm coming from a quarter zone

And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you

I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
Cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind
Now I've been thinking about this, you told me say "Yes Nan"
I'm 31 now, I'm still saying "Yes Nan"
You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one
I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like
Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like
And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm gone I want my music to play
And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about the scene I made
I say the game's better, it's a must now I've gotta fly
My talents gonna shine real shortly, fam i know it
I work round t


They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's ever been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in

When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me

You better wake up cause I A.M making moves
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training
Too busy tryna keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading
I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding
And I had to fight to get her, I am tekken (taking)
Control of my inception
Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection
See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back
Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them
See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish
Cause the haters know where the family lives
Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger
Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did
They say sleep is the cousin of death
But I ain't hearing that shh... cousin, I'm—
Gang signs I'm in LA reading (LA Reid'n)
I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next (Sway)

When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me

They're watching me, they watch me sleep
Let me go
I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep
See, all the dreams I'm fond of
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I'm Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up
And I missed my chance, worst luck
Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner
Yeah, but I walked from that ish
Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress

When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nigh


I think I took too much
I'm addicted to your touch
But I'm crying
In shame again

And now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home

Oh well, we've come this far
You're my Venus
And I'm your Mars
And we've passed the moon and stars
And I'm gone

But now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm almost gone
When you


I'm standing on a mountain
Waiting for you to come
You were sitting counting
The days that I had gone
The note I wrote
I wrapped up in a cigarette
Burned away the memories
I tried to forget
But not yet

Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
I love you

How can I tell you?
I don't know what to say
This chance that I won't miss
But I miss you anyway
I feel your pain
It's turning me insane
Thrown away
I had to take the last train home
But then you came

Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
Wishing my life away
These three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
You know it's true
I 


Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh

Leaves have fallen to the ground
And now there's no one else around
To hear the cry
Oh oh
I saw your body
I saw your face
Loss of presence
Loss of grace
Behind those eyes
Oh oh

And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone

Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh

I miss your laughter
I miss your tears
I miss your rambling
About your fears
Your smile
The crowd has gathered
All around
No one's speaking
No one makes a sound
And I...

And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
Alone
Alone now...

They're never gonna change you
They're never gonna change me
They're never gonna change us
We'll always stay the same

We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We los


I'm in so deep
Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real
Pain ain't the emotion I want to feel, but I'm thriving off it
So it's only right I like this topic, I be on a hill
Keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about, just me, myself and my shadow
And I'm parro, running out of ammo
And it seems like everyone around me's on the same path so it's narrow
The less then the better
More proof for the last one left
So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise, how they ever gonna guess I'm clever?
How can I be at my best with this pressure?
I've got a lot to lose
So when I watch the news, my minds infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress
I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds
And when they left, it looked like I'd had a rave
And invited more than a hundred guests
I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence
It's easier when you look back shoulda, woulda, coulda
But I bet you can't bring should, woulda could back
Back to 15, 
I said to myself that I'm more than a hoodrat

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out

You can never drown me out, the water supply's too low
And I'm round about 6-1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without
A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
And I'm an MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking?
Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking? I'm floating
Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin when it's in motion
Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken?
No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open
I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon
If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you
Arm for arm, eye for eye
I just want to live my life
But they don'


I stole a car last night
Don't know where we're gonna go
But go ahead and drive
I will take you home
Honey, it's cold outside
And your jumper's torn
But darling, hold on tight
I will keep you warm

And we will cry
'Til this fire is drowned
And we will write
All our memories down
And we will drive 'til these tyres wear out
But darling I, I will take you home

If we could drive all night
Until the sun is shown
I'll see it in your eyes, yeah
They will take me home
Honey, it's so damn bright
Daylight's taking over again
Just follow the signs
They will lead us home


And we will drive 'til our tyres wear out
And we will write all our memories down
And we will cry 'til this fire is drowned
But darling I, I will keep you warm
Oh darling I, I will keep you w


I woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Café clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight

I drill you deep into my chest
That’s where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
Cause I don't want to be alone

Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another song

Café clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But we're only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes

With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue
Cause I don't want to be alone

Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another song

Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sing another song

Mary Jane
I've been hoping alone
Mary Jane
Since you came along
Mary Jane
I'm almost home
Mary Jane
Sing another song

Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing me another song

Cause everyday that I’m breathing, sweet mary jane
I love the sound of your sweet words, sweet mary jane
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane 


Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Your candle burned out lo


Well my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you

‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you’re too cold
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies
And show you there’s no surprise in me’

Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that’s 


Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna give it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...
I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...
Today was gonna be the day but they'll never bring it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...
I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
You're could have be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderw


Can’t get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
I’ll say what I don’t mean
In your world we were the same
In mine now you’re the one to blame
You can’t remember my name
We’re lost, it’s such a shame

Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I’ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see

I’m strong yet proud
I’m quiet yet loud
And I’m everything
You want in me
I’m small yet tall
I have it all
And I’m everything
You want me to be

Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I’ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see

And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
I’m on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you still

Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I’ve been waiting 


She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when she's wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name—hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same

I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Don't wake up, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in (Time in)
And won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

Nah, nah
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah

So join me in this bed (This bed) that I'm in (That I'm in)
Push up on me and sweat, darling (Oh no, no, no)
So I'm gonna put my time in
And won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border (Hey)
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free

Now it seems I’ve been young, dug my hole in the ground
To me there’s only up, there ain’t no point in looking down
However hard I try, I only get weaker
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold

What you gotta do is never get yourself down
Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground
Keep out of trouble, ain’t no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now

Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it

When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky
Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived
And as the mist clears, homie I arise
From my tomb in disguise
I'm all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move
Now back up

Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it

All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who…what the fuck does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder
It don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?

Keep out of trouble, ain’t no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now

Move on, fo


Mmm, yeah you burned me again
Well, I don't wanna know where you've been
Mmm, how is your new best friend?
And do you know I will treat you like him?
And I know

You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

Apologies for the way I've been
I couldn't wash you off my skin
No I, I couldn't live without you
Mmm, tears and eyes can dry
But I know I'm burning like the wire in light bulbs
It could be in the way you bleed me
And I know

You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me


You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo

Under my skin and running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way you loved me
I guess you had 


Yeah, well the summer time is coming
As her warm breath starts to blow
She will for the spring like she's a domino
By


I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a Lego house
When things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've do


Come on now, dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you
Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags

You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say?)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away

You'll never leave me alone
Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again
And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you, I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still got to pack my bags

You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say?)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say?)
My one a


I write this song in memory of
The wayward smile
The boy we won’t forget
The soul you took away from us
The river flows
The tears that we wept

Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that you’re gone

The cheeky smile
Of jokes and laughs
The memories of times
We crossed the line
The stepping stones
Across my mind
Washed away
We a


Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah

‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know tha


I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned, I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day ah
Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
I wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
(knock, knock, knock)
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realise what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
These girls ain't loyal
That heart is so cold
This girl ain't loyal
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind (say what)
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Quick when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect 10
I wanna get in
Lemmi get down so I can win, sing it
I like the way you work it (no diggity)

Damn that girl looks good
Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo
I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And re: stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I said you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
Now
And every weekend in the winter
You'd be wearing my hoodie
With draw strings pulled tight
To keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away
We'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
Then as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear
You call me selfish, I understand
But I can't help it
I put my job over everything
Except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
So I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Uh won't you leave me now
Now
Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, go, oh won't you leave me now
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me
Both in a ro


It’s been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left for  me
All that’s left is shattered hearts
It’s plain enough for us to see that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me

We’re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It’s no fuss
I’m not in love

Twisted tunes, a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me


I lost it in your kiss, your lips
Sweetness, in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healer’s touch



Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey

Simmer down, simmer down
They say we’re too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don’t swim, you’ll drown
But don’t move, honey

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
I made a mixtape straight out of ‘94
I’ve got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down (hey, hey)
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know


White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To


Now I'm in town, break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verse? Hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tune sell?
Call yourself a singer-writer
You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
"A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi"
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can read the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow
From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide 'til we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the Myspace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You 


Well I once heard a story about a run-down home
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He’s slowly finding a way back home

He had a nice family with smiles and frowns
They never could solve his way to be down
Cos he’s one dog who don’t want a bone
He’s slowly finding a way back home
He had a nice house with windows and doors
He said to his wife what’s mine is yours
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown
He’s slowly finding a way back home
His children have left but the rooms are still there
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair
But far from the nest the babies have flown
He’s slowly finding a way back home
His wife was an angel sent from above
He never returned her kisses or love
But soon he’d found that she’d overgrown
This man who’s finding a way back home
So the leaves are all dead in this broken man’s June
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon
He stares at the floor, no more to roam
He’s 


I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
'Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I'll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
This is like claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
And take it back now
Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
You find me
In the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or 


Fell out of love with her
Just to trip straight back in
Times like this don’t come round here
And chances are slim
But eventually
You’ll be mine
Love stole my sympathy
When she belonged to him
But now I will feel the soft touch of her lips again
But chances are slim
But eventually
You’ll be mine
I won’t miss a thing
If you’re mine
I don’t care if you’re lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that
All I see, is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
Love
It won't grow back
She said it's time for a quick cigarette by the bike shed
She asked me if I’d regret it all and I said
I replied no love this about as far as it goes
See me going by the thought of you and it shows
She said you weren’t even listening
I might be too much right now man it’s sickening
Can’t believe I’m running from her
I’m stranded, her beauty is too much to bear
And oh I think I want her
And oh I swear she’s never been deep in before
And oh I think I need her
I can’t tell her I want her it's not right in summer
I think that I need her
I won’t miss a thing
If you’re mine
I don’t care if you’re lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that
All I see is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
All I see is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
Love, it won't grow back
Your love hit me like a punch in the nose
Baby you


Sara, what you do is enlighten my mind
Oh wow, I said
Sara, what you do is make my soul unwind

Hey now ‘Cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I’m in a mood
So I thought I’d write a song for you

And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
‘Cos you are great, I thought I’d say that

Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow, I said
Sara, you say that you don’t look good when you do
Even with that soul

Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I’m in a mood
So I thought I’d write a song for you

And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
‘Cos you are great, I thought I’d say that

May I say, you look great
Ma


I felt the fall on my breast
At the bottom of my stomach
She put my hand on her chest
While she looked into my eyes
You rescued me
And called up these words in threes
And you know I can’t forget it
And 10 months on you liberate truth
See, I was wrong on how I hate you
And it’s the worst thing that I did

When I read through you
You weren’t translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I’d be free from it

See, all this truth sparks lies in me
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy
The key is just to ignore
Even if this time has made me unsure
And 12 months on I’m back in my mood
See, I got drunk and said I loved you
And i


Just give me a pen and I’ll write my worries
Now and again I’ll try and not see that you don’t care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life’s bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you don’t care

And hey, I don’t speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile

They’ve written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don’t care
What ever happened to the youth and culture?
Wear chains and the same fecking Lon


Your love is the strongest thing I know
I reckon it's been doing weights
Eating raw eggs in its cereal
And running ten miles a day
And your love has a driving ban
From trying to steer intoxicated with another love inside her hands
And your love is a friend of mine
So we'll take it care tonight

If you could only say the words
I'd take it and I'd write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Until the day you found me out
But I know your love
And that's why

I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words

And your love
Has never been my enemy
Used to hold me
And promise it would never leave
Never been better since all the therapy
To read the words between the lines
And take away my melody
And your love
Told me it was turning to a different page
And you know, if I let you go
I'll still keep you safe



You are the one I fall asleep with
But never wake up to
Cause work is something you must do
I trust you like you trust me
It must mean true love
It does exactly what it says on the tin
Let me begin
You are the one I watch the movies with
For recognizing my love for Kiera Knightley for what it truly is
Just an excuse so I don't have to watch Love Actually again
But you're actually the same
It's just to spite me
And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it
Until the dishes finished
Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it
I tried to make tea once for you in bed
But all I did was spill it
So you made it for me instead
Let me in bed
If you get in ahead of me
It's better to do
Yeah, love is ahead of the truth
But in love
We are better in two
I'll be the newcomer
Stuck i


I went out late last night
And cold air met me
Lost a grip on my shoes
Walked home in bare feet
And I'll stay awake
Till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away, out
Tonight, this day won't end
The fire keep burning now
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight
I'm here again, the fire keeps burning now
I'm never gonna leave here
Let the dark cover me
And hold me tight
Hear the words in my sleep
Close your eyes for a second life within
And I'll stay awake till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away out, tonight
This day won't end, the fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight I'm here again
The fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here
Outside, in the winter, in the cold, I have not been asked where to go, and so, oh
I am here alone, waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
And day, to end, the fire is burning now
I ain't ever gonna leave here now, and I'm here again
Oh, oh I ain't ever gonna leave here
Tonight, I'm out to meet ya
Tonight, I will feel no cold
Tonight, I'll ignore that my feet hurt
An


Strings on my guitar are rusty
Even my best friends don't trust me
Everybody thinks I must be crazy

Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)

Everything's in a haze
Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze
Everything's blurry
Oh, what's happened to me?

Say, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
Now, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what


Well I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
I’m a bad influence, that’ll do
‘Cos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth, change my clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door

It’s just that they don’t care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don’t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don’t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl’s trouble

Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
‘Cos you’re a bad influence, that’ll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth, change your clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door


This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever, either
Dance as you’re a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you don’t see
Fell the weight, gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is 2D
The only thing that’s free in life is 


Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there
I walked to Spanish Point
I knew I'd find you there
I stood on the white strand
You were everywhere
Vivid memories fade
But the mood still remains
I wish I could go back
And be with you again
In Milltown there's a pub
It’s there that I sat down
I see you everywhere
Your face is all around
The search for times past
Contains such sweet pain
I'll banish lonesome thoughts
But they’ll return again
I walk along the shore
The rain in my face
My mind is numb with grief
Of you there is no trace
I'll think of this again
In far off lands I roam
Walking with you
By this cold Atlantic fog
Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of 


Well, I've walked this street
Well, I've walked this street before
And everyone's locked up their door
Cause they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what?

I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery

You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what?

I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery

It's taken you a long time to see
In misery
And everyone's locked up their door
Cause they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what?

I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery

You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what?

I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery

It's taken yo


L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful

Mmm, L.A. drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

We don't fit in well, cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful, yeah
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful

We are, we ar


Just lay it all down on me
It’s getting harder for me to breathe
Just want to know if it will be
Just want to know if it is me

And you know I’ve learned from my mistakes
And how much have I got to lose?
You find my heart is hard to break
Can’t keep playing the fool

Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what’s there beyond the pale

I feel like I’ve gone to the end of the world
What do I have to do?



What can I do
Just to let you know
That you’re in my mind?
To try and justify
The 


I’m getting very edgy
Cos you’re trying to take this from me
And it’s something that I wanted so bad
Cos you’re the definition
Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
Cos you’re a jealous girl
And all I can say is
It’s your fault but partially mine
For losing hope
For not treating you right
But that will disappear in time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what’s wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I’m losing sleep
I live only for the week

I’ve grown to ignore you
Cos when I seem to bore you
You pretend that you’re not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle
Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do
But I don’t care as long as you’re mine
It’s happening every time



And I’m falling harder now it seems
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams
And I can’t sleep although I think I can
It’s insomnia I think I have
But wh


In hotel rooms far away from home
I miss you, more than you will know
Shine a light
Just one side
To think again
That your mine
It's high time
I'm far away from home
Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down
Oh I need you, without you I'll fall apart
And last winter, I need you to feed my heart
But all the night
Sky blue
Stars are bright
Shine through
Like you
And I'm far away from home
Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down
Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

If you wanna put this on me, that’s fine
I never blamed you for anything at all, in my life
Things we try to do won’t work
So can you help me out?
Things we try to do won’t work
So can you help me out?

And say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it’s true
Cause I have fallen for you
Say if you love somebody new

See I wanna take her to the Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly Show
I could have taken anyone there
But I like the way she brushed her hair back
I never trust, begin to realize
How fast I would turn an eye
I was blind to all, yeah I saw all


Seeing this fake heart break
And stomach ache has got me
Acting like a pregnancy

I never fell for you, you tripped me
Cause even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind it's true, in my mind now
I never fell for you, you tripped me
Even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind now, my mind

(intro)
Ooooh darlin' (x4)
(Verse 1)
Its 4AM beneath the stars under the night,
and you're here, and you're here.
With candles lit the room is dark the moon is light,
we can lay here, we can love here...
(Chorus)
Forever,
is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.
Ooooh darlin' (x2)
(Verse 2)
I bought some food, a change of clothes, a little wine,
and a blanket,
and we used them all...
I dreamt the day away on a planet full of life,
and just stayed there,
i fell in love there.
(Chorus)
Perfect comes near,
perfect just for one,
and forever, is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.
Ooooh darlin' (x2)
We're lying down her cheek is resting on my shoulder,
play with her hair, i adore her.
This is the single sweetest love I've ever known yeah,
we can stay here, run away dear.
(Chorus)
Love knows no fear,
Father doubted some,
forever, is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it 


Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night
Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat
Still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night
Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time, ‘cos I won’t mind
I doubt if I even know that I’m awake
And still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memor


I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryin' act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I'll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
And take it back now
Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinth can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint of McDaid discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
Mmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
Very superstitious, writings on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past
Believing things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way

Superstition, babe

Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
I wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

You've got scars on your body and your soul
Bruises on your back now
Broken heart with nowhere to go
Living in a high-rise flat
Torn apart, so keep on keeping it together
Nothing is forever you know
You can start again like this, like this

Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, color the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars

You can never be alone if you're bleeding with the skyline
Waiting for the right time
When the night's already gone
It's been traveling without your mind now
Let it let go and fuel you like petrol
You find so much beauty in what makes you mental
Your friends know it's only
A state of mind, you're only getting by
By always getting high, that's why

Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, color the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars

I can take away your sc


I want to be real
Not some conscience to myself
The way you worship, never ending
Some idol who’s pretending to be true
How you put upon yourself
A man who never seems
To answer to you words
So go and make me over

I’m a fly upon your neck
You can’t control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need

Don’t want your advice
Cos I’ve made up my own mind
The way you bore me with the stories
Of far and distant times
I’ve heard it before
So don’t try that on me
The way you worship, never-ending
Some idol who’s pretending to be true
It could be you
Brainwashed by the lies
It’s no surprise
Th


In shadow there lies hope
Cut tension with a knife
I find it hard to cope
Stop playing with my life
You analyse my fears
Analyse my dreams
Choke on burning tears
Through my silent screams

Things aren’t what they seem

Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I’ll let you all see that I’m doing better

Watch me fall
As I stumble at your feet
Always losing in this game
Your lies cut me deep
And you don’t even know my name
With your consistency
To always make me crawl
And my durability
Not affected at all



Feel the pain
On my brain
Feel the strain
As I start to decay
Feel the strain
Every passing day
Fee


You're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I'm searching for what used to be mine
I saw your eyes
And then I saw her staring back at me
And I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you
She was mine
I was hers
And all that's in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be
If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear,oh
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you
Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
If you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn
Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scarred and left me
Like a sunburn
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I wa


You know I got to get away
To find some peace and sanity
I’ve been playing hide-and-seek too long
Shaking, making, everybody waking
Setting the hi-fi bleed
Keeping me back
While you’re spinning my track
That’ll knock you off your feet
Monkey see what monkey do
But I’m a monkey telling you
I just think that we should take a break
Tickity-tock the clock
With the hip-hop
And Alonestar backing me up
We won’t stop
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind
Now let the track rewind

And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on
[Verse 2:
This is Alonestar coming at you
With a new style
Kicking dust
Ready to bust
It's Urban Angel
Artistic, flipping the script
Who'd you really want to get it with?
Ed and Alonestar
We're like live wires sparking
Ready to blow
We've already sown our seeds
We're just waiting to grow, blow
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body
Metaphorical speech when we come and see
You ducking for cover
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock
With Urban Angel and Alonestar
And Ed, keep it locked
Let the beat pump
Drop the bass but don't stop
We're kicking the sound
Let the bass bins pound
We're gonna roll
Can you feel me now with my body?
Get down to the sound
It's Ed Sheeran in the place
And Alonestar rising up
W


On Saturday I know that you're coming up to see me
When I go away things will change
And you'll never know it was easy
It won't help pretending that we'll stay close
I can't help thinking that
I try to pretend that it's your loss
And I never know, oh I'll never know if it will work
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
And I left her today
And I left her today
Come Sunday I'll see that one day you'll rescue me
And when I leave again I'll feel strange
And I'll never know, oh I'll never know if you're in love again
I can't stop being a fool for you
I won't help thinking that
Still I am falling for her and she did too
Oh I'll never know, oh I'll never know if I'm in love
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her today
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a foo


Pass me a drink
You say it’s gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile

You’re wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don’t reach
Your smile
You’re holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You’re eating your fears
In a cigarette
You’ve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea

I’ve taken the blow
It’s all down on paper
Had fun in t


Mr. Ruskin come and paint my picture
We’re losing sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now who’s your best friend?
Can you introduce me?
See I can’t seem to even let you breathe

When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind’s eye
Please let me forget that I’m standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me

Come and show me if you can
See I know you’re me
But I can’t seem to understand
If you know me, place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
It’s psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need y


I found the words to say how I feel
But I just can’t spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field
So you can tell them
That I’m a different man with a different tune
I didn’t find love until last June
But I lost it, just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
‘Cos I need something, anything to 


It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight
Hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say
That that's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today
Hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up

Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's truе
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Evеry pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
Burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh


Think it's written on a notebook somewhere
Can you feel it as you breathe the night air, yeah
I can't remember what you said to me
But I know it was hard, hard, hard for you to speak
Time drift as you speed into love
Heart race as you heat up my blood, yeaaah
Let's just continue what we used to do
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth
And it's late, it's late
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Drift off into space without care
Can you see it as you sit back in prayer, yeah
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth
Sleep tight and I will not wake you up
Kiss me and I want to be in love, heeey
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth
And it's late, it's late, no
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
I can't let go
I miss you
I can't let go
I miss you

Take me with you I do declare
I love you dearly through here and there
What can I do to make you share?
What can I do to make you care?

The world is harsh
I’m stuck in the dark
I’ll make my mark
I’ve got my spark

We’d be together through bad or worse
Sending letters we shall converse
We could do better but we must first
Make amends
That 


I’m screaming out upon my face
Followed footsteps catch my pace
Broken windows fall in place
Now shattered lovers find their place
We’d flirt
And you’d treat me like dirt
All the pain and the hurt
Just to make matters worse

And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
You’re better off with me

We’re stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass

All I ever felt for you
Went up in a cloud of smoke
How I could I be such a fool
To 


Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm...
Oooh, I'm overdue
Give me some room, coming through
Paid my dues, I'm in the mood
Me and my girls gonna shake the room
DJ spinning, show your hands
Let's get dirrty, that's my jam
I need that, uh to get me off
Sweating until my clothes come off
It's explosive, speakers are thumping
Still jumping, 6 in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are crashing
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (Can you feel it), 'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise
Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm...
Ah, heat is up
Ladies, fellas drop your cups
Bodies packed, front to back
Move your arse; I like that
Tight hip huggers (low for show)
Shake a little something (on the floor)
I need that (uh) to get me off
Sweating until my clothes come off
Let's get open, cause a commotion
Still going, 8 in the morning
There's no stopping, we keep it popping
Hard rocking, everyone's talking
Give all you got (give it to me)
Just hit the spot
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise
Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival
It's the one you been wait'n on
Get up get it rough, yup that's what's up
Giving just what you love to the maximum
Uh-oh (Uh-oh) Here we go (here we go)
What to do when the music starts to drop
That's when we take it to the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Uh-oh (Uh-oh) Here we go (Here we go)
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooooh
Yo, hot damn, Doc a Jam like a Summer Show
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas (ow!)
If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina (what), better hop in here
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair (han)
The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up baby it's Brick City, I heard of that
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac (Bernie Mac)
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB, the way I'm gonna get
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's a


I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the seen, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and iris's they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they won't be closing soon
Cos i know that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say what ever I feel to vent a rhyme
So i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cos we all recognise, real is what my father says
And i'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But i'll just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close
DEVLIN
5 o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear i said, that i'll sleep when im dead
Whos on the beat upon the feature with Ed its D-E-V to the Z
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage i've acquired
And over the time within this maze i'll think you'll find you'll never find that peace of mind you seek to find until your dying
Cuz i got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
Its time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be
The times i'm living in lately
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me wrong
But they won't slither in too easy, believe me im snake minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that im in
Its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows
Some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with si-li-cone
Im still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cos I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die!
Never die
DEVLIN
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months cos i haven't slept in them, true!
Im coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so im correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'oh wow its its Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect from 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be. x4



Sing the song Celestial Man
Shake the thing your mother gave ya!
Tear your lungs out, scream your heart
Be on your worst behaviour
I’d wager that you’re gonna take it
Make you fight nature, born and raised in
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night
Turn off the dark, put on the light
And he said ‘You and your big cheeks have got me’
Along with ‘Disarm’ and ‘Flooded Quarry’
Turn off the base with the beat-box detox
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black
You make the room’s hands laugh as they clap
You make my mouth water with support acts
They could even match you in talent - ignore that!
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain’t wrong
He’s got me singing to ‘Amerikan Folk Song’
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry
You gotta know your enemy
Gotta check your distance
Don’t talk, only whisper
Slap the base so hard you get blisters
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom
JP beat-box, feet as flip-flops
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand
This ain’t no fake, it’s music in your hand
As you run into the centre of the crowd
Silence falls like water
You just wanna shout ‘Wow!’
How did they even have the guts to do it ?
If your name’s Nizlopi, then there ain’t much to it
‘Cos you and your big cheeks h


Come on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in the moment this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

Who will love you?
Who will fi


Nuair is léir nach seasann do chosa níos mó
Is nach leanann do shúil mar a bhíodh
An mbeidh teacht ar do bhéalín ar bhlaiseadh mo ghrá?
An mbeidh d’aghaidh ag fógairt d’aoibh?

A stórín, beidh mé ag fanacht leat féin go seachtó naoi
A leana, is tú an duine dom fiú ag fiche trí
Tá mé ag rá leat go dtiteann daoine i ngrá gan aon chúis ná haon bhrí
B’fhéidir gan ach buille ar lámh
Titim féin i ngrá leat arís is arís
Tá rud ar intinn agam le rá

Bí liom ann Féadfaidh tú mé a thógáil anocht
Ó luí liomsa faoin solas ón oíche gheal
Éist le buillí mo chroí ar m’ucht
Ag smaoineamh os ard
A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhan

Nuair atá mé níos sine is ag briseadh go mall
Dearmad déanta ar m'ainm arís
Gan mo lámha in ann don mhéid céanna
Ó is tú a bheidh fós i mo chroí

Beidh tú liomsa, is mise leastsa go deo mo chroí
Tú le feiceáil gach oíche i mo bhrionglóidí

Tá mé ag rá leat go dtiteann daoine i ngrá gan aon chúis ná haon bhrí
B’fhéidir go mba chuid é don phlean
Mise agus tusa le chéile go deo
Ag glacadh go mbeidh tuilleadh ar lean

Bí liom ann
Féadfaidh tú mé a thógáil anocht
Ó luí liomsa faoin solas ón oíche gheal
Éist le buillí mo chroí ar m'ucht
Ag smaoineamh os ard
A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhan
A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhan
A leana, fu


Made of clay, shoot me down
I'll ricochet to the ground
Words of paint, draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know it's over before it's begun
I lost my way, so help me out
And lend your hand 'til I am found
My voice is mute, not to be heard
So it's up to you for you to bring those words

I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time

This grief you give, it takes its toll
It dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree, whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned stones, oh

I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For t


Chicago on a Friday night
I was walking from a bar with a friend of mine
We heard sirens and saw blue lights
Right in front of us
Seems her man took another mans life
I can search a wrong and never make a right
What's worst by the end of the night?
There'll be somethin' else, somewhere else
As the sun sets over the hills
In Los Angeles and New York
Somebody's tryna find a place to sleep
But daddy's lookin for daughter down in New Orleans tonight

Hey man, just one more night in America
Hey man, just one more night in America

Miami on a Saturday night
Drinks are flowing all around and the pad is wide
Hope is low but the heels are high
Yeah, this town's alive, oh, na-na
She only wanted to feel some love
Didn't get much when she was growin' up
Men tried but they were never enough
She needs somethin' else or somewhere else
And in Vegas, someone's gamblin'
A family dream are two roads down
Her mother lives in poverty, hopin' her soldiers on a call
And say, "Mama, I'm fine."

Hey man, just one more night in America
Hey man, just one more night in America

Every time I'm here, everywhere I go
I can see the beauty, I can feel the hope
Oh, and some folks try, some folks cry
Some folks die for the stars and stripes

Hey man, just one more night in America (Just one more night)
Hey man, just one more night in America (Just one more night)
Hey man (Hey man), it's one more night in America
(Just one more night, oh, na-na)
Hey man (Hey man), it's one more night in America
(Just one more night)

Well my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you

‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you’re too cold
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies
And show you there’s no surprise in me’

Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that’s 





, baby, let's ride
Mmm, excuse me, , blame it on the juice and 


No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely

Another night, another club
Another room, a new one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
But I'm lonely, in LA

No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
That one night stand, could just be the one, yeah

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark

Another night, another day
Another city, another plane
Another heart I'm gonna break
Another mili on the cardiae
A young girl my heart broke, so I don't wanna get close
I don't know why you're not enough

No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
But I ended up being one anyway
Man you can never change me
This is my world, I run this city and I'm in my own lane
Sometimes being solo is the way to
'Cause I love the way I get some
But you never know though cause maybe you
Could just be the one, ayy

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark

No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark

No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely

I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a 


I keep my hopes and dreams inside you amongst these other things
My mother seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering
Never been known as my government name
My foster home is where I've been placed away from the pain
And now you sit before me, with a folder holding my story
You're my saviour with nothing on me but hope and glory
And surely, you'll never ignore me
'cos when the court came the court date was made to disappear for me
You think you understand me, but never what I went through
But you were never meant to, I won't hold it against you
I take a ball point pen to play dot to dot
With the cigarette burns etched in my forearms
Forget me not, never let me stop, you'll just sit and watch
It's your job to be patient so you'll let me off
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life in a day through a child's eyes

And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleep's the only thing I want to take me away, away

Okay session's over time to get back to the classroom
I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard too
You told me I should try my best but guess what, I still find this trigonometry a head fuck
Constantly told I won't pass my GCSEs
I'll end up in Mac D's serving burgers and cheese
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em
Lately classmates think I'm crazy
Turn up daily resembling Bill Bailey
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it
Without new clothes or shower it's hard to do so
After school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes
But they'll get taken off me when I get back to the group home
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life i


Stevie was a boy
Who turned into a man
He never had no master plan
But I knew that he could
Find right from wrong
Sing me a different song
He told me which road to take
And now I’m gone

Keep on singing
Make her life whole
Stevie you’re winning
And I just feel cold
Take your life beyond the mark
You can do no wrong
When I lose my way in the dark
Keep singing your song

Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe
Please come follo


Standing at the bar
And your eyes are telling me come closer
But if you could see me dance
There's no way that you would let me hold ya
I feel you pulling on my hand more
And dragging me to the dance floor
All my inhibitions fall away
Feel the rhythm of the track
And telling the DJ pull it back...
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say

Softly do you feel that you could love me
And want me
More than anybody else
But then again

It could just be the baseline
That made me close my eyes
opened up my mind
Could you come back with me tonight
It's not the first time
that we've been on our own
So I'll hold you close
And never let you go

You can keep me on the dance floor
But I don't wanna waste your time
Feel the rhythm of your hips more
It makes me wanna taste your wine
It's getting hard to keep in time
When I'm looking in your eyes
Everyone but you just fades away
Feeling the rhythm of the track
And telling the DJ pull it back
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say

Softly do you feel that you could love me
and want me
more than anybody else
but then again

It could just be the bassline
That made me close my eyes
opened up my mind
Could you come back with me tonight
It's not the first time
that we've been on our own
So I'll hold you close
And never let you go

How, could I take you home tonight
I should be hailing a cab
But I don't w


If we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when i wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, ohh
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We could lay down, so I'm next you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me
And if I wake up, say its late love get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
And of all this thing I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You made me scream but then I made you cry when I left that little bird with its broken leg to die
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoaa
My little bird

Saturday, me and my girlfriend are at a party in the West End
And I don't really know nobody here either
Maybe we should've stayed home
And turned down the lights so low
Open up a  Bordeaux, mmm
And put on a jam so slow, so slow

She said, "All the girls here are beautiful"
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Why are we even here?
'Cause all the boys got their eyes on you
For the same reason that my eyes are too
And that's when she made her move
And whispered in my ear and said

Hey, let's leave this party (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
Back to my apartment (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home

I'm still here with my best friend and I'm not
Disappointed that the party
We just can't fit in with the West End crowd
Can't even hear their conversations, so
Baby, let's hit the road and open up a  Margot, mmm
And put on a jam so slow, so slow

She said, "All the girls here are beautiful"
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Why are we even here?
'Cause all the boys got their eyes on you
For the same reason that my eyes are too
And that's when she made her move
And whispered in my ear and said

Hey, let's leave this party (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
Back to my apartment (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home

Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, no love (Mmm)
Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, mmm

Turned down the lights so low
And put on a jam so slow, so slow
'Cause all the people are beautiful
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Whisper in my ear, hey

Hey, let's leave this party (Party, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Back to my apartment (Apartment, hey-ey-ey-ey)
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home

Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, no love (Back at home)
Come on and get it (Back at home)

There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get t


I'm coming down, coming home
No, ’cause I left without my coat
There's just some things you need to know, know, know
Your eyes, they are a window to your soul
It's such a lovely place to go
Think I should tell you more, you know, know, know

But now I’m older
Drips are coming off my shoulder, oh
I need its closure
On what you said to me 'cause I

I can never be mad with you, baby
'Cause the love that we have is amazing
You drive me (Drive me) crazy (Crazy)
But that ain't a bad thing, no, no, no
I can never be mad, mad, mad
I can never be mad

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Now, I don't really wanna fight
Let's keep the conversation light
Spark thе candles, pour the wine-inе-ine
My father gave me good advice
Sort out your problems by the time
That you finally close your eyes and I

But now I'm older
Drips are coming off my shoulder, oh
I need its closure
On what you said to me 'cause I

I can never be mad with you, baby
’Cause the love that we have is amazing
You drive me (Drive me) crazy (Crazy)
But that ain’t a bad thing, no, no, no
I can never be mad, mad, mad
I can never be mad

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I can be awful sometimes
But we both just crossed the line
I wanna make this so right
But this time

I can never be mad with you, baby
'Cause the love that we have is amazing
You drive me (Drive me) crazy (Crazy)
But that ain’t a bad thing, no, no, no
I can never be mad, mad, mad
I can never be mad

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
And one works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the suns


When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
(Ah la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la)
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we
