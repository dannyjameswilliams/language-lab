# Language Lab
This is the landing page for the language lab given on 8th November 2021 and 12th September 2022. Here you will find the instructions for the key pieces of the lab. In general, I thought it would be interesting to use really big AI models that companies and large institutions use, for our own purposes (my suggestion is song lyrics).

These are the general instructions.

### Language Generation

1. Go to the following page: [Google Colab Language Lab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B_R92OzhmSUG1rGWNnGUApWPKBuwiIg1?usp=sharing). 
This is the page where most of the code can be run and the lab is run from.
2. (Optional) Create your own lyrics using [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G9kkiwLSTFKQKBhZm5Mgze68y6N35uyx?usp=sharing), or find your own text-based dataset via other means (you might want to start with song lyrics for the moment).
3. Follow the instructions on each notebook, be creative and have fun with the models!
4. If you have any issues with the code or the notebooks or anything, raise a hand or get our attention so we can find you and help you.


### Bonus: Image Generation with language

As an extra this year, I have also included a section on image generation with diffusion models! If you are finished with the language section, or would find this more fun, feel free to go over this too.

[The notebook for this can be found here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MCawDZlYOHmL1uuxMkJRpeRCgssTZ5Ky?usp=sharing)
