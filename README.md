# Language Lab
This is the landing page for the language lab given on 8th November 2021. Here you will find the instructions for the key pieces of the lab. In general, I thought it would be interesting to use really big AI models that companies and large institutions use, for our own purposes (my suggestion is song lyrics).

These are the general instructions.

1. Go to the following page: [Google Colab Language Lab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B_R92OzhmSUG1rGWNnGUApWPKBuwiIg1?usp=sharing). 
This is the page where most of the code can be run and the lab is run from.
2. (Optional) Create your own lyrics using [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G9kkiwLSTFKQKBhZm5Mgze68y6N35uyx?usp=sharing), or find your own text-based dataset via other means (you might want to start with song lyrics for the moment).
3. Follow the instructions on each notebook, be creative and have fun with the models!
4. If you have any issues with the code or the notebooks or anything, raise a hand or get our attention so we can find you and help you.

If you have any questions about what you are doing, about NLP, about COMPASS or anything, come and find me or Shannon. We will be happy to help!
