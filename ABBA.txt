I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
"Bye-bye", leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
"Bye-bye" doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing qu


I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)

But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

(So the winner)
(Takes it all)
(And the loser)
(Has to fall)
(Throw a dice)
(Cold as ice)
(Way down here)
(Someone dear)
(Takes it all)
(Has to fall)

Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you

I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)

So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still, I'm thinking about you only
(Still, I'm thinking about you only)

There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be all right
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight

Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

Half-past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight


There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the da


Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

If I had to do the same agai


They passed me by, all of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy

And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

That's how I started the show, one of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

Never left at all

Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us


My, my - at Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah - and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

My, my - I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh, yeah - and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

So how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo, Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo, Waterloo, kno


I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your e


Take it easy with me, please
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze
Take your time, make it slow
Andante, andante, just let the feeling grow

Make your fingers soft and light
Let your body be the velvet of the night
Touch my soul, you know how
Andante, andante, go slowly with me now

I'm your music (I am your music and I am your song)
I'm your song (I am your music and I am your song)
Play me time and time again and make me strong
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
Make me sing, make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
Andante, andante, tread lightly on my ground
Andante, andante, oh, please don't let me down

There's a shimmer in your eyes
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies
Please don't talk, go on, play
Andante, andante, and let me float away

I'm your music (I am your music and I am your song)
I'm your song (I am your music and I am your song)
Play me time and time again and make me strong
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
Make me sing, make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
Andante, andante, tread lightly on my ground
Andante, andante, oh, please don't let me down


Make me sing, make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
Andante, andante, tread lightly on my ground
Andante, andante, oh, please don't let me down
Andante, andante


Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now, I see you've broken a feather
(How it hurts to see you cry)
(And how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown-out candle
All is gone, and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
(You and I, we know)
(How all the heartaches come and go)
You'll be dancing once again
(You’ll be dancing once again)
And the pain will end
(And all the pain you take will end)
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

Try once more, like you did befo


A while ago, I heard the sound of children's laughter
Now it's quiet, so I guess they left the park
This wooden bench is getting harder by the hour
The sun is going down, it's getting dark
I realise I'm cold, the rain begins to pour
As I watch the windows on the second floor
The lights are on, it's time to go
It's time at last to let him know

I believe it would be fair to say
You look bewildered
And you wonder why I'm here today
And so you should, I would
When I left, I felt I'd had еnough
But in the shape and form I appear now
I havе learned to cope
And love and hope is why I am here now

And now you see another me, I've been reloaded, yeah
I'm fired up, don't shut me down
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
I'm fired up, I'm hot, don't shut me down
I'm not the one you knew
I'm now and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind (And I won't be the same)
I'm not the same this time around (Ooh)
I'm fired up, don't shut me down

Will you leave me standing in the hall
Or let me enter?
The apartment hasn't changed at all
I got to say I'm glad
Once these rooms were witness to our love
My tantrums and increasing frustration
But I go from mad
To not so bad in my transformation (So now)

And now you see another me, I've been reloaded, yeah
I'm fired up, don't shut me down (Don't shut me down)
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
I'm fired up, I'm hot, don't shut me down
I am not the one you knew (I'm not the one you knew)
I'm now and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind (And I won't be the same)
I'm not the same this time around (Ooh)
I'm fired up, don't shut me down

You asked me not to leave
Well, here I am again
And I love you still and so I won't pretend
I have learned to cope
And love


I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad?
And still, there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad

In my dreams, I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
A-ha, ah
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

A man like that is hard to find, but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad?
And if he happens to be free, I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad

So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
A-ha, ah
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
A-ha, ah
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's 


Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while

The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny

What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go?
(Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers


Slipping through my fingers all the time
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodb

A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Giving out a spark

Everybody screamed
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was

Taken by surprise (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Couldn't quite believe his eyes (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

I was in a trance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Suddenly I took the chance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Leaning over me
He was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher

One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

What a crazy day (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
All my sense had flown away (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

(I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him) When I kisse


When you were lonely, you needed a man
Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

Men are the toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw 'em away
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, belie


I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance

Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

So I say thank you for 


I've seen it on your face
Tells me more than any worn-out old phrase
So now we'll go separate ways
Never again we two
Never again, nothing I can do

Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly (See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely (Answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind
My love, my life
Are the words you try to find
My love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only

I've watched you look away
Tell me, is it really so hard to say?
Oh, this has been my longest day
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through

Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly (See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely (Answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?

You are still my love and my life
Yes I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and


Where are those happy days? They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?

You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood
What happened to our love? It used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?


So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S

Chiquitita, dime por qué
Tu dolor hoy te encadena
En tus ojos hay una sombra de gran pena
No quisiera verte así
Aunque quieras disimularlo
Si es que tan triste estás, ¿para qué quieres callarlo?

Chiquitita, dímelo tu
En mi hombro, aquí llorando
Cuenta conmigo ya, para así seguir andando
Tan segura te conocí
Y ahora tu ala quebrada
(Duele verte triste)
(Y duele verte llorar)
Déjamela arreglar, yo la quiero ver curada

Chiquitita, sabes muy bien
Que las penas vienen y van y desaparecen
Otra vez vas a bailar y serás feliz
Como flores que florecen
Chiquitita, no hay que llorar
Las estrellas brillan por ti allá en lo alto
Quiero verte sonreír para compartir
Tu alegría, Chiquitita
Otra vez quiero compartir
Tu alegría, Chiquitita

You're so hot, teasing me
So you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl, you're only a child

Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile
Smile, but girl, you're only a child

Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy

I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future, even if you fail

I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream

I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness; still another mile

I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream

I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?

Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow

And you make me talk (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me feel (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me show (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I trust in you (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you let me down? (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I said I care for you? (Ah-ah)
Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know
The name of the game

I have no friends, no one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you?
(Got a feeling you give me no choice, but it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?

The summer air was soft and warm
The feeling right, the Paris night
Did its best to please us
And strolling down the Élysées
We had a drink in each café
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy
And I smiled like Mona Lisa

We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power

But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play


And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry

How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
We were living for the day
Worri


No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say

Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway

Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine

Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as w


No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye

Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

Memories, good days, bad days (Memories, good days, bad days)
They'll be with me always (They'll be with me always)
In these old familiar rooms, children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

There is nothing we can do

We just have to face it, this time we're through

Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)

I, I've been in love before
I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
Still, strange as it seems to me
You brought it back to me
That old feeling

I, I don't know what you do
You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think you'll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
And you ease me

You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I've laid my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you

I, I'm gonna make you mine
You're gonna feel so fine
You'll never want to leave me
I feel you belong to me
Someday you will agree
Please, believe me

You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I've laid my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
Oh, I've been waiting for you

Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na-na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na

Honey, honey, how you thrill me, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, nearly kill me, aha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy

Honey, honey, let me feel it, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, don't conceal it, aha, honey honey
The way that you kiss goodnight
(The way that you kiss me goodnight)
The way that you hold me tight
(The way that you're holding me tight)
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing

I don't wanna hurt you, baby, I don't wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you, boy, you'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be

Honey, honey, touch me, baby, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, hold me, baby, aha, honey honey
You look like a movie star
(You look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are
(I know just who you are)
And, honey, to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast

So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be

Honey, honey, how you thrill me, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, nearly kill me, aha, honey honey
I heard about you before
(I heard about you before)
I wanted to know some more
(I wanted to know you some more)
And now I know what they mean
You're a love


Here's to us, one more toast, and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside, both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done


It's so strange, when you're down, and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done

Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry any


I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came


I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of "Dallas" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound o


Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
"Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play"

Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

Keep thinking
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Keep thinking, had to pay the price
Keep thinking
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Keep thinking, had 


I still have faith in you
I see it now
Through all these years, that faith lives on somehow
There was a union
Of heart and mind
The likes of which are rare and oh-so hard to find

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share

I still have faith in you
And I will say
I never really thought I'd feel this way
But I remind myself
Of who we are
How inconceivable it is to reach this far

Do I have it in me?
I believе it is in there
For I know I hear a bittеrsweet song
In the memories we share

We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story
And it survived
And we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage
Is everything

I still have faith in you
It stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes down to love

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
Do I have it in me?

We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story
And it survived
And we know that we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage
Is everything

(I still have faith in you)
And we still have it in us
We've only just arrived
(Do I have it in me?)
We stand on a summit
Humble and grateful
To have survived

I still have faith in you
It stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes do


Jo, jo - vid Waterloo Napoleon fick ge sig
Men, men - sitt  öde kan man möta på så många skilda sätt

Själv känner jag,  sen jag mött dig
Historien upprepar sig

Waterloo, jag är besegrad, nu ger jag mig
Waterloo, lovar med nöje att älska dig
Waterloo, allting känns rätt, och det är min tro
Waterloo, du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo

Jo, jo - man värjer sig och fäktas i det längsta
Men, men - mot känslor kämpar gudarna förgäves har man sagt

Det är som jag hörde en sång
Jag tror det är kärlek på gång

Waterloo, så har man funnit sin överman
Waterloo, mäktig och väldig och stark är han
Waterloo, allting känns rätt, och det är min tro
Waterloo, du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo

Det är som jag hörde en sång
Jag tror det är kärlek på gång

Waterloo, allting känns rätt, och det är min tro
Waterloo, du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo
Waterloo, du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Waterloo, du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo

I got appointments, work I have to do
Keeping me so busy all the day through
They're the things that keep me from thinking of you
Oh, baby, I miss you so, I know I'm never gonna make it
Oh, I'm so restless, I don't care what I say
And I lose my temper ten times a day
Still it's even worse when the night's on its way
It's bad, oh, so bad

Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sitting here alone and staring at the wall
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)


No one to turn to, you know how it is
I was not prepared for something like this
Now I see them clearly, the things that I miss
Oh, baby, I feel so bad, I know I'm never gonna make it
I got my business to help me through the day
People I must write to, bills I must pay
But everything's so different when night's on its way
It's bad, oh, so bad

Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sitting here alone and staring at the wall
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
If it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
If it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)

Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)

If it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
If it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look brig


I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, "Oh, that's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry"
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

Love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too? I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past
Now I just made it, I found you at last

So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do


Oh, no hard feelings between you and me
If we can't make it, but just wait and see

So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
So love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too


Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so
(You know that I'm nobody's fool)
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no
(I'm kind of flattered I suppose)
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen, where I'd be if I fell

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I won't know how


Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody see and save a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart



I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?

Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh

Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh

Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

Oh-oh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Oh-oh, ring, ring, why don't you giv


I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me

The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up


These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming, through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up


Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting

They must know by now I'm in here trembling

¿Puedes escuchar, Fernando?
Me recuerda tiempo atrás, estrellas y una noche allá
En la lumbre azul, Fernando
Tarareabas tu canción con ese suave guitarrear
Yo podía escuchar esos tambores con un sordo redoblar

Se acercaban más, Fernando
Y el momento que pasaba parecía eternidad
Y sentí temor, Fernando
Por la vida y juventud, nadie pensaba en morir
Y no siento hoy vergüenza al confesar que tuve ganas de llorar

Algo había alrededor, quizá, de claridad, Fernando
Que brillaba por nosotros dos, en protección, Fernando
No pensábamos jamás perder ni echar atrás
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando

La vejez llegó, Fernando
Y con ella, una paz que hoy logramos disfrutar
Se durmió el tambor, Fernando
Pareciera que fue ayer que lo vivimos tú y yo
Y en tus ojos veo aún aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor

Algo había alrededor, quizá, de claridad, Fernando
Que brillaba por nosotros dos, en protección, Fernando
No pensabámos jamás perder ni echar atrás
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando
Algo había alrededor, quizá, de claridad, Fernando
Que brillaba por nosotros dos, en protección, Fernando
No pensabámos jamás perder ni echar atrás
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando

Y si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando

Are you sure you wanna hear more?
What if I ain't worth the while
Not the style you'd be looking for?
If I'm sweet tonight
Things look different in the morning light
I'm jealous and I'm proud
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Would I be the one you seek
Mild and meek like the girl next door?
Don't you realise
I may be an angel in disguise
It's lonely to be free
But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

I don't believe in fairy tales
Sweet nothings in my ear
But I do believe in sympathy
That's me, you see

Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Won't you have a drink with me
Just to see you're not really sore?
I can't help my ways
I'm just not the girl to hide my face
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me, mhm
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me


There's a special love
Like an eagle flying with a dove
I'll find it in the end
If I keep on searching, but until then
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind


I was at a party and this fella said to me
"Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights"

I said, "Who are you to talk about impending doom?"
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, "I'm a minister, a big shot in the state"
I said, "I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?"
He said, "Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone"

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone

Over in the corner, I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, "Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?"
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, "If you're going somewhere can I come along?"
I said, "Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone"

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone


On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on


"They say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul
A voyager, and a settler, they both have a distant goal
If I explore the heavens, or if I search inside
Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself
I've always tried"

Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on

I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive

Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on


The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain

Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on

Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of it, being in it
With the urge to move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on

Yo por ti me engañé, hace tiempo lo sé
Y ya lo decidí, ahora te dejaré
Mírame bien; ¿cuándo aprenderé?
No sé por qué vivo tanto esta gran pasión
Que me quema el corazón

Si me miras, siento tanto placer
Si te acercas, creo desvanecer, woah

Mamma mia, una y otra vez
No sé cómo resistirte
Mamma mia, quiero y tú lo ves
No sé cómo evadirte
Tú que me has provocado
Luego me has rechazado
¿Por qué te sigo queriendo así?
Mamma mia, ya lo decidí
Porque no puedo vivir sin ti

Tú me has hecho enojar con tu modo de ser
Y quisiera olvidar tantas cosas de ayer
Mírame bien; ¿cuándo aprenderé?
No sé por qué vivo tanto esta gran pasión
Que me quema el corazón

Si me miras, siento tanto placer
Si te acercas, creo desvanecer, woah

Mamma mia, una y otra vez
No sé cómo resistirte
Mamma mia, quiero y tú lo ves
No sé cómo evadirte
Tú que me has provocado
Luego me has rechazado
¿Por qué te sigo queriendo así?

Where is the spring and the summer
That once was yours and mine?
Where did it go?
I just don't know
But still, my love for you will live forever

Hasta Mañana till we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Mañana, baby
Hasta Mañana, until then

Where is the dream we were dreaming
And all the nights we shared?
Where did they go?
I just don't know
And I can't tell you just how much I miss you

Hasta Mañana till we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Mañana, baby
Hasta Mañana, until then

Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Mañana,


They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell

They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything

There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please


And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas

Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart
Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart
Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips
Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you

Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs
But they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss

Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong
Still, it's making me scared that my love is so strong
Losing you is a nightmare, baby, and to me it's new
Never before did you see me begging for more

Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs
But they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss

Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
(I'm at the point of no returning)
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss
(Caught in a landslide of emotions)
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions

Just a notion, that's all
Just a funny feeling deep inside (Ah-ha-ha)
That you're out there waiting
You're not sure I'm alone
And you wonder if I'm occupied (Ah-ha-ha)
So you're hesitating

Just a notion
That you'll be walking up to me in a while
And you'll smile and say hello
And we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from there on must be right
Just a notion
But somehow, I know I'm not wrong
There's something happening that I just can't explain
If I tried, it's all in vain

Because it's just a notion, that's all
Just a feeling that you're watching me (Ah-ha-ha)
Every move I'm making
Am I reading your mind?
'Cause it's almost like you're touching me (Ah-ha-ha)
Thеre is no mistaking

Just a notion
That you'll be walking up to me in a whilе
And you'll smile and say hello
And we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from there on must be right
Just a notion
But somehow, I know I'm not wrong
It is our destiny, there's nothing we can do
And tonight is very special, it's a night for me and you

Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha (I, I think it's more than a notion)
(Even more than your dream is about to come true)
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha


The city is a jungle, you'd better take care
Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe me, you'd better beware
Of me

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner, and try not to scream
It's me

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

The city is a prison, you'll never escape
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows, and you'll see the shape
Of me

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

And if I meet you, what if I eat you?
I am the tiger
I am behind you, I always find yo


They came from the hills
And they came from the valleys and the plains
They struggled in the cold
In the heat and the snow and in the rain

Came to hear him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon

Sub luna saltamus

They came from the south
From the west and the north and from the east
They waited for the man
Like a parish is waiting for the priest

Longed to hear him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon

Sub luna saltamus

He gave them a dream
He seduced everybody in the land
The fire in his eyes
And the fear was a weapon in his hand

So they let him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon


This park and these houses, old streets I have walked
Everything dear, will it be here
One day when I am returning?
My friends will get married, have children and homes
It sounds so nice, well-planned and wise
Never expecting surprises

I wonder, it's frightening
Leaving now, is that the right thing?
I wonder, it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I don't even try?
I'm not a coward, oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes, I will take it, it can't go wrong

My friends and my family, this dull little town
Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed
Everything old and familiar

I wonder, it's frightening
Leaving now, is that the right thing?
I wonder, oh, it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I don't even try?
I'm not a coward, oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes, I will take it
Yes, I w


Tyst och död är telefon
Står där nästan som ett hån
Inte ringer du och säger "Älsklig" nu som du gjorde
Allting är så tyst mot förr
Ingen knackar på min dörr
Det som lockat mig frestar inte, nej, som det borde

Inget roar mig just nu
Ingen annan bara du, åh

Ring, ring, bara du slog en signal
Ring, ring, tystnaden är så total
Ring, ring, skingra den oron som mal
Om jag fick en signal, tog jag ett språng
Hjärtat gjorde en volt, ding-dong bing-bong
Om du ring, ring, ringde en endaste gång
Om du ring, ring, ringde en endaste gång

Att en telefon kan va'
Lika tyst varenda dag
Om det vore så, det var nåt fel ändå, men desvärre
Om den bara sa ett knyst
Om den inte blott var tyst
Om jag fick nån lön för nån enda bön av vå Herre!

Inget roar mig just nu
Ingen annan bara du, åh

Ring, ring, bara du slog en signal

Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone in your bed
Pity, Cassandra, that no one believed you
But, then again, you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply ,still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait

Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

I watched the ship leaving harbour at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain

Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

(I'm sorry Cassandra)
(I'm sorry Cassandra)
(I'm sorry Cassandra)

Sometimes when I'm mad
There's a part of me that seems to be a little sad
Sometimes when I scream
There's a voice in me that says, "You shouldn't be so mean"
Oh no, oh no
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside
Yes, I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde

We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes we're a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
We're a funny combination
Me and I

I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
Everyone's a freak

Sometimes I have toyed
With ideas that I got from good old Dr. Freud
Nothing new of course
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors
Oh no, oh no
I just wanna say a lot of that applies to me
'Cause it's an explanation to my split identity

We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes we're a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
We're a funny combination
Me and I

I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
Everyone's a freak

You think you're gonna make me softer with your fancy car
Ah-ha-ha
But I can tell you all your tricks ain't gonna get you far
Ah-ha-ha
They say that money's got a magic touch
But not to me, it doesn't mean that much
You won't have me tonight
Alright, alright, alright, alright

So long, see you, honey
You can't buy me with your money
Tracey, Daisy, they may be crazy
But I'll never be your girl
So long, see you honey
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
So long, so long, so long

You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today
Ah-ha-ha
I wouldn't keep a thing from you, I gave them all away
Ah-ha-ha
The girls might fall for everything you've got
But I'm not one of them, you know I'm not
You won't have me tonight
Alright, alright, alright, alright

So long, see you, honey
You can't buy me with your money
Tracey, Daisy, they may be crazy
But I'll never be your girl
So long, see you honey
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying

He had what you might call a trivial occupation
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
With no romance in his life
Sometimes he wished he had a wife
He read the matrimonial advertising pages
The cries for help from different people, different ages
But they had nothing to say (Nothing to say)
At least not until the day (Till that day)
When something special he read
This is what it said:

"If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
(If you are dreaming of someone who might be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)
We're the answer if you feel blue
(We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with we two)
So call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)"

He called the number and a voice said, "Alice Whiting"
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold he'd struck
He said, "I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don't we meet for a chat (Meet for a chat)
The three of us in my flat? (In my flat)
I can't forget what I read"
This is what it said:

"If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
(If you are dreaming of someone who might be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)
We're the answer if you feel blue
(We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with we two)
So call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)"

She said, "I'm sure we must be perfect for each other
And if you doubt it you'll be ce

Al bailar, al girar
Sabes reír y vibrar, uuh
Miren bien, allí va
Como una reina, ya

Viernes, noche y adonde ir
Todo listo para salir
Luces por todas partes, busquen un lugar
Música y a bailar
Uno y todos a disfrutar
Hay un ritmo sensacional
Con un rock muy violento, largas a bailar
Nadie te va a parar
Y en la multitud

Brillas con plenitud
Reina al fin, toda juventud
Tu inquietud
Reina al fin, toda juventud, oh-oh

You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden, way down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst (And when you're feeling so bad)
And you think you're cursed (And you've got it sad)
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose

It's gotta be rock 'n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock 'n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul

My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool
But on all weekends (Together again)
When I meet my friends (I'm gonna see them now)
And we're looking 'round for the action, we sure play it cool

It's gotta be rock 'n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock 'n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul

Ah-ha (ah-ha, ah-aa) You paint your world and use all colours
Ah-ha (ah-ha) And then you find it all comes out too bright
You know it's only a lie
Ah-ha (ah-ha, ah-aa) The songs you sing are too romantic
Ah-ha (ah-ha) And when you want the truth
They only spit in your eye
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock 'n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul

You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden, way down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst (And when you're feeling so bad)
And you think you're cursed (And you've got it sad)
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose

End of night, a new day dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on a beach

Summer night city
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong

I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

It's elusive call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone

I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park

I'll never know why I had to go
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough

And now, look at me standing here again
'Cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Got to have you near

As good as new, my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new, thank God it's true
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep
How could I make such a dumb mistake?
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break

But please, baby, I beg you to forgive
'Cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Got to have you near

As good as new, my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new, thank God it's true
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again

As good as new, my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new, thank God it's true
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

Yes, the love I have for you feels as good as new

"Noll... ett, två, tre"

He stands towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on, the usual way, he's such a clever guy
Then I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

He's dressed in the striped pyjamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives me of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does, and me I get so tired
And I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is...)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry?

Strange how dangerously indifferent I have grown
Cold as a stone
No more pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on, I feel my throat go dry
And I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is...)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon

So at last, you're free
It's the way you wanted it to be
And the price you paid
To become a woman of today

Is it worth the pain to see the children cry?
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy?

Hey, hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen
Can you make it alone? (Yes, you can)

So you're free at last (I am a woman)
And beginning to forget the past (Like a woman)
Does it make you sad (Do you know me?)
When you think about the life you ha-ha-had?

But you're right, you had to take a second chance
So you fight to find your freedom

Hey, hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen
Can you make it alone?
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey Helen)
What's the matter with you?
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey Helen)
Don't you know what to do? (Yes, you do)

Aha, yes you do, yes you do
Aha, yes you do, yes you do

Hey, hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen
Can you make it alone?
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey Helen)
What's the matter with you?
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey Helen)
Don't you know what to do?
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey Helen)
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey


Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an


You hate, you scream, you swear
And still you never reach him
You curse, you try to scare
But you can never teach him

It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane, a nowhere train for
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine

You know they're going to get you
You try to break away
But they will never let you

It's a dead-end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane, a nowhere train for
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine (You're like a goldfish in a bowl)
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine (They have your mind, they'll take your soul)

You come, you stay, you go
It really doesn't matter
You've done it all before
By now they'll know the pattern

It's a dead-end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet

Now that you're gone
You know they're going to get you

You know they'll never let you go

People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand

"You're so free," that's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward-bound, pushed around refugee
Something's wrong, got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I had come from outer space, out of place, like King Kong

I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, round and round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown

Like a doll, like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk, how to walk, how to fall


Can't complain, I've got no-one but myself to blame
Something's happening I can't control, lost my hold, it's insane

I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, round and round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown

"Look this way, just a little smile," is what they say
"You look better on the photograph if you laugh, that's okay"

I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, round and round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown

"You're so free," that's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward


Making somebody happy is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much?
Sweet, sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender

Like a bang, a boome-boomerang
Dum-de-dum-dum de-dum-de-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boome-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boome-boomerang is love
A boome-boomerang is love

Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool
Every feeling you're showing
Is a boomerang you're throwing

Yes a bang, a boome-boomerang
Dum-de-dum-dum de-dum-de-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boome-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boome-boomerang is love

And if you're warm and tender
I'll kiss you, return to sender, please surrender

Bang, a boome-boomerang
Dum-de-dum-dum de-dum-de-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boome-boomerang is 


El reloj
Ya marcó medianoche, y otra vez encontré
Que tan sólo me acompaña la TV
El soplar
De ese viento afuera, vive la desolación
Me oprime con angustia el corazón

No hay más que soledad
Nadie, ni por piedad

¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Alguien que me ayude a las sombras borrar
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Hasta que amanezca, ver el dí­a aclarar

Tantos hay
Con gran suerte y fortuna, todo pueden conseguir
Tan distinto a lo que tengo que vivir
Aburrida
Me encuentro esta noche y la gran oscuridad
Es mi siempre obligada amistad

No hay más que soledad
Nadie, ni por piedad

¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Alguien que me ayude a las sombras borrar
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Hasta que amanezca, ver el dí­a aclarar

¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!


No hay más que soledad

Do I hear what I think I'm hearing?
Do I see the signs I think I see?
Or is this just a fantasy?
Is it true that the beast is waking
Stirring in his restless sleep tonight
In the pale moonlight?

In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way
Taking a chance
'Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance

What's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble?
Won't somebody tell me what I hear
In the distance but drawing near?
Is it only a storm approaching?
All that thunder and the blinding light
In the winter night

In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way
Taking a chance
'Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance

The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way

I can hear how you work, practising hard
Playing night and day, woah woah
And it sounds better now
Yes, you improve every time you play, woah woah

But it's bad
You're so sad
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin

Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby

You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time
Wish I was, dum dum diddle, your darling fiddle

But I think you don't know that I exist
I'm the quiet kind, woah woah
From the day when I first listened to you
You've been on my mind, woah woah

You don't care
It's not fair
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin

Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby

You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time

Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby

You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time

Put on your white sombrero
Saddle your horse my dear
And ride off into the sunset
You'd better go for there is no
Place for you here

Like an old fashioned hero
You stand before me
Oh, you think our life is a movie
My world is real I live and feel
And I can do without you


Put on your white sombrero
Your red bandanna too
Think of this day as a showdown
Goodbye my friend, this is the end
For me and you

Now be a bold vaquero
Don't show your feelings
I'll cry while you're disappearing
Into the night, all dressed in white
Unchained and free, without me

Put on your white sombrero
Like all the cowboys do
Go find a sweet señorita
Somebody meek, who'll never speak
Harshly to you

You're such a caballero
Proud, never bending
I want someone who will take me
Just as I am, I need a man
Who is in rhyme with his time

Oh, you'll never take me
Just as I am, I need a man


No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table
Though I would have liked to begin
So much that I wanna say, but I feel unable
You leave and slam the door
Like you've done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go?
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like dying

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end


Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up
The sound of the key in the door
You smile and I realise that we need a shake-up
Our love is a precious thing
Worth the pain and the suffering
And it's never too late for changing

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to t


Every day in the morning on her way to the office
You can see her as she catches a train
Just a face among a million faces
Just another woman with no name
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree
Because I know she's got a little secret
Friday evening she turns out to be

Nina, pretty ballerina
Now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waited for
Just like Cinderella (Just like Cinderella)
Nina, pretty ballerina
Who'd ever think she could be this way?
This is the part that she likes to play
But she knows the fun would go away
If she would play it every day

So she's back every morning to her work at the office
And another week to live in a dream
And another row of early mornings
In an almost never-ending stream
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain
Everybody seems to think she's a bore
But they wouldn't know her little secret
What her Friday night would have in store

Nina, pretty ballerina
Now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waited for
Just like Cinderella (Just like Cinderella)
Nina, pretty ballerina
Who'd ever think she could be this way?
This is the part that she likes to play

Rock me, give me that kick now
Rock me, show me that trick now
Roll me, you can do magic
Baby, and I can't get enough of it
Rock me, give me that feeling
Roll me, rocking and reeling
Baby, so don't stop doing it, don't stop doing it, now

Don't stop the rocking
Don't stop the rocking
I said don't stop the rocking

Wanna be, wanna be in my baby's arms
Gonna be, gonna be
Nice and gentle if you want me to
Just as long as I'm in love with you
Yours forever, honey, that's what I
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, yeah

I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep, the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry


Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry


Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when the day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the mus


I believe your new girl turned you down
And they say she's pushing you around
How does it feel? I guess it hurts your pride
Tell me my friend, how many nights you cried

Disaster and disgrace - the king has lost his crown
Suddenly he's clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown

Was it hard to step down from your throne
And to know tonight you're all alone?
Oh, what a shame, you really want that girl
She doesn't care, still, you just dream of her

Disaster and disgrace - the king has lost his crown
Suddenly he's clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown
Disaster and disgrace - the word is all around
Suddenly he's clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown

Disaster and disgrace - the word is all around

No más champagne
La bengala se apagó
Solo tú, sola yo
El festejo ya pasó
Es el fin de la fiesta
Y hay un gris amanecer
Donde está ese ayer
Que debemos proponer

Felicidad, felicidad
Al brindar les deseamos de ahora en más
Paz, amor en donde reine la amistad
Felicidad, felicidad
Al rogar esperanza de cambiar
Sin dejar al desaliento dominar
Y triunfar

Y cuando veo
Ese mundo que vendrá
Nuevo al fin llegará
De cenizas surgirá
Gente equivocada
Que pretende estar muy bien
Se los ve arrastrar
Pies de barro y caminar
Sin saber por donde andar

Felicidad, felicidad
Al brindar les deseamos de ahora en ms
Paz, amor en donde reine la amistad
Felicidad, felicidad
Al rogar esperanza de cambiar
Sin dejar al desaliento dominar
Y así triunfar

Creo entender
Que los sueños son infiel
Al morir no son más
Que confites y papel
Es el tiempo pasado
Y en los años que vendrán
Quien podrá predecir
Que depara el porvenir
Que nos falta por vivir

Felicidad, felicidad
Al brindar les deseamos de ahora en más
Paz, amor en donde reine la amistad
Felicidad, felicidad
Al rogar esperanza de cambiar
Sin dejar al des





I was up with the morning sun
Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house 'cause I had to talk
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
Then I realised
It's a crazy world

As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
Then I realised
It's a crazy world

Baby, how could you do it?
You just told me lies
And you meet behind my back with other guys
Baby, how could you tell me
There was only me?
I was stupid to believe you, I was blind but now I see

Then you smiled and you took my hand
"There is something," you said, "that you may not know
There's a couple of men in my life
And one of them is my brother Joe
He's been gone for a long, long time
But he's back and I think he's going to stay
You'll be seeing a lot of him
He's so nice in every way"

And I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
Then I realised
It's a crazy world
So I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
Then I realised
It's a crazy world

So I close my eyes
Never lea


Did you see that man in the limousine?
With the pretty girl, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill

Did you see that man with a fat cigar?
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
While the rest of us drink a beer

'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle

In the middle, in the middle, in the middle...

But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy an honest friend

'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle

In the middle, i


Déjà - à Waterloo Napoléon a dû se rendre
Et moi - je crois que mon destin prend aujourd'hui le même chemin

Les livres d'histoire et la vie
Racontent la même comédie

Waterloo, tu es vainqueur et je perds la guerre
Waterloo, je me constitue ta prisionière
Waterloo, je ne peux plus fuir et plus t'échapper
Waterloo, pour la vie je promets de t'aimer
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Il est arrivé mon Waterloo

Pourtant - j'ai bien tenté de résister mais en vain
Alors - je crois que ma seule chance est d'abandonner le combat

Comment faire encore pour y croire
Quand je souhaite ta victoire

Waterloo, tu es vainqueur et je perds la guerre
Waterloo, je me constitue ta prisionière
Waterloo, je ne peux plus fuir et plus t'échapper
Waterloo, pour la vie je promets de t'aimer

Comment faire encore pour y croire

Oh, my love it makes me sad
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did
Everything we had?

Baby, give me one more
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye

Yes, all we have to do is
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance, don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye

Yet it seems to make me sad
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did
Everything we had?

Baby, give me one last
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me, when you're gone
You know I won't forget you
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away
You tell me it's over, what more can I say?
So dance while the music still goes on
It's going to be our last goodbye

Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye

Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me, when you're gone
Dance while the music still goes on
You know I won't forget you

¿Dónde quedó el verano
Aquel que nos unió?
¿Dónde se fue?
Yo no lo sé
Si aún mi amor sigue por ti vivendo

Hasta mañana te sabré esperar
Dime tú, el lugar
Es que la fuerza de un amor así
Sabe triunfar siempre a pesar de todo
Hasta mañana te sabré esperar
Junto a ti, quiero estar
Escríbeme, y te lo explico
Perdóname, te lo suplico
Hasta mañana, dime
Hasta mañana, mi amor

¿Dónde quedó nuestro sueño
Aquel que se escapó?
¿Dónde se fue?
Yo no lo sé
Si aún mi amor sigue por ti vivendo

Coming through a cloud you're looking at me from above
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size
And you feel a strange attraction
The air is vibrant and electrified
Welcome to me, here I am, my arms are open wide

Somewhere in the middle of the never-ending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets
People come and take their chances
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose a lot
Come, make your own contribution to this melting pot

I'm the street you walk, the language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells and the turmoil of cars
And the people, the air that you're breathing is me
Yes, I am the city, you let me be

People feed me with their lives, I am a hungry soul
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
Dazzled by the crazy magic
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind, if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh

I'm the street you walk, the language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells and the turmoil of cars
And the people, the parks and the squares that you see
All the sounds that you hear and the air that you're breathing is me
Yes, I am the city, you let me be

I am the city
You let me be
I am the city

The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells and the turmoil of cars
And the people, the air that you're breathing is me

I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty, there was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night as I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying as though he was praying
Ah...

"Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help some day
We depend on one another
Love him, that's the only way
On the road that we're going
(On the road)
We all need words of comfort and compassion
(We all need)
Treat him well, he is your brother
Love him, that's the only way"

I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying I heard someone saying
Ah...

"Treat him well, he is your brother (Brother)
You might need his help one day (He's your brother)
We depend on one another (Brother)
Love him, that's the only way
On the road that we're going
(On the road that we're going)
We all need words of comfort and compassion

Treat him well, he is your brother (Brother)
You might need his help one day (He's your brother)
We depend on one another (Brother)

Treat him well, he is your brother (Brother)

Well I was looking at a movie on the TV last night
Then I had a very funny notion, yeah
I really had to write a song about it
And then I'm gonna sing it with my rock 'n' roll band
And I bet the people gonna like it, yeah
I know that everybody's gonna shout it

And what a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla

We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the King Kong song, gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom?
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song

Now we can make the jungle out of any old place
We can make gorillas out of people, yeah
Well, who can tell a monkey from a monkey?
So people get together, gonna have a good time
Everybody listen to the music, yeah
'Cause what we're gonna sing is kinda funky

So let your arms hang down
And waddle all around
Like a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla

We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the King Kong song, gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom?

Early this morning I drove in the rain
Out to the airport to get on the plane
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii
Alice has been there, she said it was fun
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii

After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (Making no plans, ooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance

Guess I've been working a little too hard
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card
From Honolulu, a greeting from happy Hawaii


It's so exciting, why should I pretend?
In a few hours, the plane will descend
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii
I can imagine the beach and the sand
Walking with someone and holding his hand
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii

After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (Making no plans, ooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance, mmm

I've got a feeling the dream will come true
Somebody's waiting and I'll forget you
Hey Honol


I am just a girl, one among the others, nothing much to say
Plain and simple girl, not a special type in any way
Just one look, and you will surely see
That the true "Miss Nobody" is me
It's an evil world that has only made me a girl

I am just a girl, not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl no-one ever looks at in the street
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered "I love you"
Darling, I could see I was meant to be your girl

It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone
And thinking that he'll never look your way
But then he says he loves you, and life has just begun
It's so much more than any words can say

I am just a girl, not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl no-one ever looks at in the street
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered "I love you"
Darling, I could see I was meant to be your girl

La la la la la, la la la la la-la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la-la, la la la
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered "I love you"
Darling, I could s


Do you remember the first time and all of your sweet, sweet talk?
Ain't heard it a lot since then love
Now look at that guy, he's making me cry
He leaves every morning and he hardly says goodbye

But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow
Darling, I know

We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Giving
Love is a reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)

From the first moment I saw you I've treated you like a queen
I've given you lots of presents
Now listen to that, just look at that cat
You'd think he was an angel, but he's talking through his hat

But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow
Darling, I know

We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Giving
Love is a reason for living
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough

Love isn't just a sensation

Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough

Changing, moving in a circle
I can see your face in all of my dreams
Smiling, laughing from the shadows
When I hear your voice I know what it means
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try
You're all the reason for my life

Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down?
You're all I had, you're all I want
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have

Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd?
Thinking, wondering, what you're doing
I can't stop myself from crying out loud
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar
But then, they'd never shared our love

Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down?
You're all I had, you're all I want
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have

Disillusion, disil


Tried to sneak out without saying
With my loudest record playing
Ooh, my mama said
"Look at this, you haven't done your bed"
My mama said
"That's a thing that you should do instead"

Yeah, I did what she had told me
Dying for my friend to hold me
Ooh, my mama said
"Try and get one thing into your head"
My mama said
"Pa and me, we give you room and bed"

How I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life

In the morning she said "Listen"
Ooh, I felt like in a prison
Yeah, my mama said
"I know you've been out again with Fred" (My mama said)
My mama said
"Don't you lie, your cheeks are blushing red" (My mama said)

Oh, I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life


I said, "I can live without him
How I wish you wouldn't doubt him."
Ooh, my mama said
"If you want to hurt me go ahead" (My mama said)
My mama said
"I suppose you'd rather see me dead" (My mama said)

Oh, I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life

La-la-la, la-la-la, life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life
La-la-la, la-la-la,


Day is dawning and I must go
You're asleep, but still, I'm sure you'll know
Why it had to end this way
You and I had a groovy time
But I told you somewhere down the line
You would have to find me gone
I just have to move along

Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord, give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations

When you wake I know you'll cry
And the words I wrote to say goodbye
They won't comfort you at all
But in time you will understand
That the dreams we dreamed were made of sand
For a no-good bum like me
To live is to be free

Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord, give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations

Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord, give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spe


Honey, honey, underbara, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, söta rara, aha, honey honey
Dom viskar så söta ord
Du är deras allt på jord
Det där ska du inte tro, bara ta det med ro
Sen är bara smicker

Honey, honey, inte illa, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, flicka lilla, aha, honey honey
Den kvarnen som mal är tom
Och det är en ynkedom
Nej, killar som snackar så litar ingen på

Det brukar va' dom som sviker, som ivrigast hållit me'
Men vet man det bara så kan man nog klara det
Tro inte på önskesmicker, och passa dej vad du gör
Och håll dej med benen på jorden, ja, vad du än hör

Honey, honey, viskar alla, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, lätt att falla, aha, honey honey
Men tro bara det du vill
Och lägg inte märke till
Det söta du alltid hör, som så många gör

Tro inte på smicker, nej, passa dej vad du gör
Ja, håll dig med benen på jorden, ja, vad du än hör

Honey, honey, underbara, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, söta rara, aha, honey honey
Men socker är inte allt
Så ta't me' en nypa salt
Och är du förståndig se'n, ta


Soy muy sencilla, y algo aburrida tal vez
Las bromas que sé, me salen seguro al revés
Pero hay un talento, en mí singular
Y es que la gente me escucha al cantar
Y me hace feliz
Orgullosa lo puedo anunciar

Por eso quiero dar las gracias, a las canciones
Que transmiten emociones
Quiero dar las gracias
Por lo que me hacen sentir, debo admitir
Que con la música vale vivir
Por eso quiero dar las gracias, por este don en mí

Todos decían que fui una niña precoz
Baile y canté, y sobresalí por mi voz
Y hoy me pregunto, ¿Cuál es la razón?
¿Por qué siempre gana la gran atención una simple canción
Si he hace con el corazón?

Por eso quiero dar las gracias, a las canciones
Que transmiten emociones
Quiero dar las gracias
Por lo que me hacen sentir, debo admitir
Que con la musica vale vivir
Por eso quiero dar las gracias, por este don en mí

Que suerte tuve, soy tan dichosa al cantar
Quiero que todos disfrutemos juntos
¡Qué feliz, qué placer exclamar!

Quiero dar las gracias, a las canciones
Que transmiten emociones
Quiero dar las gracias
Por lo que me hacen sentir, debo admitir
Que con la musica vale vivir
Por eso quiero dar las gracias, por este don en mí

You say she's been mad at you
Then you say you'll be patient
Still I see that she makes you blue
Come on, I'll give you consolation

Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right
You're all I ever need, my darling

Just to be where you want to be
So much fun we could have then
To be yours for eternity
What a miracle to happen

Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you
I know she doesn't make it easy
'Cause you don't please her like you please me

You're my love, you're my angel
You're my first, you're my last
Would she care if you lingered
For another night?
Wanna hold you tight
We could make it right

Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right
I know she doesn't make it easy

Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you
You're all I ever need, my darling

And I would lov


Look at her face, it's a wonderful face
And it means something special to me
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me
How lucky can one fellow be?

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

And when we go for a walk in the park
Then she holds me and squeezes my hand
We'll go on walking for hours and talking
About all the things that we plan

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?


She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do?

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever b


I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight


And I feel so good, and I feel so right
And I know that you must have a lovelight

You've got lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You've got lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

Everything about you is right
Let it glow and let it be bright
I don't want to lose your lovelight

See me sitting in the palm tree
Looking down at people passing by
Sitting here no one can harm me
They just stare at me and wonder why

No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here
Whatever happens, I won't let no one near

Until you tell me
Ginny, Ginny on my mind, won't you please
You really love me
Ginny, Ginny oh so fine, yes you are now
And in the evening, when the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest of men in this town
'Cause I love you
Ginny, Ginny on my mind

See me sitting in the palm tree
Waiting for those little words from you
People laugh and point their fingers
Like I was a monkey at the zoo

But I will stay here, among my coconuts
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got
Now won't you tell me, Ginny, Ginny on my mind

Winds blow, stars glow
I see a light in her window
Dark trees, soft breeze
Carry my message to her, please

See me sitting in the palm tree
Feeling angry at the silly crowd
No one else but you can calm me
You should know by now I'm far too proud

I need to show you, I've got my feelings too
You shouldn't treat me like you always do

So won't you tell me
Ginny, Ginny on my mind, won't you please
You really love me
Ginny, Ginny oh so fine, yes you are now
And in the evening, when the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest of men in this town
'Cause I love you
Ginny, Ginny on my mind

Ginny, Ginny oh so fine
Ginny, Ginny on my mind
Ginny, Ginny oh so fine
Ginny, Ginny on my mind
Ginny, Ginny oh s


Yo lo soñé, y el corazón
Me habló de amor con emoción
Si vives la magia de hadas que hacen bien
Verás que el futuro sonrie también

Creo en angelitos
Que me cuidan siempre de caer
Creo en angelitos
Que la vida linda me hacen ver
Y llegaré
Yo lo soñé

Yo lo soñé, no fue ilusión
Y me ayudó en mi aflicción
Y la fantasía a la oscuridad
La transforma en día en una verdad

Creo en angelitos
Que me cuidan siempre de caer
Creo en angelitos
Que la vida linda me hacen ver
Y llegaré
Yo lo soñé
Y llegaré
Yo lo soñé


Yo lo soñé, y el corazón

Si vives la magia de hadas que hacen bien
Verás que el futuro sonrie también

Now there's a shadow falling over our faces
Doubt forever in our hearts
And in a while we'll stop to pick up the traces
We won't find the missing parts

Buy me a ticket, I'll go to the Bahamas
I need a rest from our daily little dramas
Yes, I really do

Aha, mhm (Now look what you've done)
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun (I've missed all the fun)
Baby, you owe me one
Aha, mhm (It's my turn to run)
My turn to run
A chance to feel the sun (Feel the sun)
Baby, you owe me one

I wasn't ready for this kind of intrusion
I was taken by surprise
Now both of us are in a state of confusion
Hesitation on our hearts

Something unwanted has entered our existence
I think it's better to view it from a distance
Yes, I really do

Aha, mhm (Now look what you've done)
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun (I've missed all the fun)
Baby, you owe me one
Aha, mhm (It's my turn to run)
My turn to run
A chance to feel the sun (Feel the sun)
Baby, you owe me one
Aha, mhm (Now look what you've done)
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun (I've missed all the fun)
Baby, you owe me one
Aha, mhm (It's my turn to run)
My turn to run
A chance to feel the sun (Feel the sun)
Baby, you owe me one


Aha, mhm (Now look what you've done)
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun (I've missed all the fun)

Spójrz jak szybko minęły nam lata te
Sami nawet nie wiemy kiedy i gdzie
Stoimy tu
Wokół ludzi tłum
Pytacie nas "skąd ten smutny szum bierze się?"
Dzisiaj pożegnać się nadszedł czas
Jeszcze jedną chwilę a może dwie
I już tak jak dziś nie spotkamy się
Ooo...
Mamma mia
Dziś jesteśmy tu
Tak tak po raz już ostatni
Mamma mia
Czy wrócimy znów do tych wszystkich twarzy bratnich?
Tak mamy serca płaczące choć usta są śpiewające
Bye bye, tak musimy odejść stąd
Mamma mia teraz wiemy to
Że to był ostatni w szkole rok
Czasem byliśmy fajni a czasem nie
Czasem też się zdarzało, że było źle
Lecz kiedy znów, wrzesień będzie już
Wspomnijcie nas i zetrzyjcie z pamięci kurz
Bo to czeka każdego z was
Na każdego ucznia przychodzi czas
Dzisiaj żegnasz się ty
A jutro ja
Ooo...
Mamma mia
Dziś jesteśmy tu
Tak tak po raz już ostatni
Mamma mia
Czy wrócimy znów do tych wszystkich twarzy bratnich?
Tak mamy serca płaczące choć usta są śpiewające
Bye bye, tak musimy odejść stąd

On Top of Old Smoky

On top of Old Smokey, all covered with snow
I lost my true lover by courting so slow
For courting's a pleasure and parting is grief
And a false-hearted lover is worse than a thief
On top of Old Smokey, all covered with snow
I lost my true lover by courting so slow
Midnight Special

Well, you wake up in the morning
Hear the ding-dong ring
You go marching to the table
See the same old thing
See the fork on the table
Nothing in your pan
If you say a thing about it
You're in trouble with the man

Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its ever-loving light on me

If you ever go to Houston
Well, you'd better act right
And you'd better not gamble
And you'd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And he'll take you down
And before you understand it
You are prison bound

Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its ever-loving light on me, on me, on me
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its ever-loving light on me, on me, on me
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its ever-loving light on me, on me, on me
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special

Come to my loveland, wander along
Beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs
Come to the sunshine, beaches and sand
Listen to bluebirds, won't you come to my land?

The grass is mellow and the sky is blue
My paradise is waiting here for you

Ooh, it's a tropical loveland
Ooh, I wanna share it with you
Life can be funny, happy and sunny
Ooh, in my tropical loveland

Come to my loveland, wander with me
(To my loveland, to my loveland)
Lie with me darling in the shade of a tree
Over the rainbow, under the moon
(To my loveland, to my loveland)
That's where my land is, won't you come to me soon?

Just take my hand, I'll show you everything
The secrets that my paradise can bring

Ooh, it's a tropical loveland
Ooh, I wanna share it with you
Life can be funny, happy and sunny

Went to buy me a paper at the local newsstand
And then I heard them laugh and say
"Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now
Hey, what's it good for anyway?"

So I said, "Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may"

What about Livingstone?
What about all those men
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way?
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
Wasn't it worth it then?
What about Livingstone?

And all of those fellas at the local newsstand
Didn't know what to answer or what to say
So I told them about him, that he was just like
One of those spacemen in his way

And if you laugh at them, then there's only a thing I can say

What about Livingstone?
What about all those men
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way?
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
Wasn't it worth it then?

What about Livingstone? (Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
What about all those men (Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way?
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while (Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
Travelling up the Nile (Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest? (Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
Wasn't it worth it then?

What about Livingstone? (Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
What about all those men (Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
Who have sacrifice


We're not the stars of a hollywood movie
So what's the use to pretend?
I'm not so charming and you're not so groovy
You've gotta face it, my friend

Dream world, you've been living in a dream world
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dream world
Here I am, there you are, we've gotta make it together
And we've made it so far, so it can only get better

When you reach out
And you say to me, "How I love you, girl"
When I hold you
Baby can't you see? It's a real dream world

You had your hopes and your high expectations
Somehow it doesn't seem right
I'm getting fed up with your accusations
I'm not your angel in white

Dream world, you've been living in a dream world
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dream world
Here I am, there you are, we gotta make it together
And we've made it so far, so it can only get better

When you reach out
And you say to me, "How I love you, girl"
When I hold you
Baby can't you see? It's a real dream world

Dream world, you've been living in a dream world
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dream world
Here I am, there you are, we gotta make it together
And we've made it so 


You move like a flame of fire
Your eyes like a flash of lightning
The answer to all desire
And I'm gonna tame you, wild thing

You'd better watch out
I said you'd better watch out
Watch out - anywhere you go I'll find you
Watch out - I'll be staying close behind you
And I'm tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
Oh, you'd better watch out
I said you'd better watch out

It's been kind of funny lately
You act like I was a stranger
I think you're beginning to hate me
But then you're a girl in danger

You'd better watch out
Ooh, I said you'd better watch out
Watch out - anywhere you go I'll find you
Watch out - I'll be staying close behind you
And I've tired of waiting
Yes it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
So you'd better watch out
Yes I said you'd better watch out
Watch out, watch out

And I'm tired of waiting
Yes it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
I said you'd better watch out
Girl, you'd better watch out
Ah, you'd better watch out

Ya no hay más sonrisas
Todo finaliza
Nuestra casa hoy vacía, me hace llorar
Y la historia aquí termina, hay que olvidar

Solo tú, sola yo, aha
Poco y nada se logró
Solo tú, sola yo, aha
Nuestro amor quién puede negar, pasó
(Negar pasó se termino, pasó se termino, se termino)
Separarse es tan difícil lo sé, pero yo me iré
(Pero yo me, difícil lo sé, pero yo me iré)
Conociéndome a mí, conociéndote a ti

Bueno, malo, tanto (Bueno, malo, tanto)
Guardo, risas, llanto (Guardo, risas, llanto)
En los cuartos donde vimos, niños jugar
Hoy hay sólo un gran silencio, en el lugar

Solo tú, sola yo, aha
Poco y nada se logró
Solo tú, sola yo, aha
Nuestro amor quién puede negar, pasó
(Negar pasó se termino, pasó se termino, se termino)
Separarse es tan difícil lo sé, pero yo me iré
(Pero yo me, difícil lo sé, pero yo me iré)
Conociéndome a mí, conociéndote a ti


Solo tú, sola yo, aha
Poco y nada se logró
Solo tú, sola yo, aha
Nuestro amor quién puede negar, pasó
(Negar pasó se termino, pasó se termino, se termino)
Separarse es tan difícil lo sé, pero yo me iré
(Pero yo me, difícil lo sé, pero yo me iré)

"Den går på band!"
"Kan de' va' nåt?"
"Det tror du va..."
Take a Chance on Me

"Ett, två, tre, fyra."


"Nu går den långsammare än förut."
"Nej. Ett-två-tre-fyra. Det är bra så."


"Ett-två - går bandet?"
"Här är det magnetband som rullar och rullar!"
"Upptakten kan du fixa på nåt annat va? Nåt jättemalle. Ett-två…"

Baby

"Du kan dra ner pianot tror jag för det är väldigt vasst i öronen."
"Vasst."
"Vasst."
"Väldigt miserabel lyssning."
"Nu hör jag bara Frida i mina lurar!"
"Och jag hör bara dej!"
"Det är inget. Det var inget. Bättre lyssning."
"Hörru hör du mej nu ra?!"
"Ja, det är så neråt tror jag."
Ja-ja!


"Hör du mig?"
"Hör du mig?"
"Det är inte bra alltså. Men det är upp till dig. Det måste väl du förstå vad som är fel."
"Ture! Jag sjunker!"
"No, that's right."
"Sjunker 'u?! Ja"

Baby, you can do magic
Baby, isn't it tragic?
Maybe you can do something
I can't and I can't get enough of it
Baby, you can do wonders
Maybe you can do something
I can't, so don't stop doing it, don't stop doing it
Baby, you can do wonders...
Just a Notion

Just a notion, that's all
Just a feeling that you're watching me
Every move I'm making
Am I reading your mind?
'Cause it's almost like you're touching me
There is no mistaking

Just a notion
That you'll be walking up to me
In a while and you smile and say hello
Then we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from there on must be right

Just a notion
But somehow I know I'm not wrong
If it's our destiny there's nothing we can do
But tonight is very special
It's the night for me and you
Rikky Rock 'n' Roller

"Är det bra?"
"Det tycker jag vi kan ha va? Det är lite ovanligt så där också?"
"Ja, det är det va. i alla fall nuförtiden."
"Javisst!"
"Alla... sextio miljoner skivor ska brytas! "

Rikky Rock 'n' Roller, now that you're the headline
Rikky Rock 'n' Roller, don't it make you feel fine?
Is it true to hear the fans scream
To stand in the lights is just like a dream?
What a dream to be what you are
A rock and roll star
To make such a lot of money
Would be funny
Oh I wish I could be like you, Rikky Rock 'n' Roller

Today a new jet plane
Tonight it's a new hotel
You live in your own world
You're under a magic spell

Rikky Rock 'n' Roller now that you're the headline
Rikky Rock 'n' Roller don't it make you feel fine
Is it true to hear the fans scream
To stand in the lights is just like a dream?
What a dream to be what you are
A rock and roll star
To make such a lot of money
Would be funny
Oh, I wish I could be like you, Rikky Rock 'n' Roller
Oh, I wish I could be like you, Rikky Rock 'n' Roller
Oh, I wish I could be like you, Rikky Rock 'n' Roller
Burning My Bridges

"Ett, två, tre, fyra."

Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad
And I've always been under your heel
Holy Christ, what a lousy deal
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways
And I ain't gonna take it no more
Oh no, no, walking out that door

Burning my bridges, cutting my tie
Once again I wanna look into the eye
Being myself, counting my pride
No-one right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride
Burning my bridges, moving at last
Girl, I'm leaving and I'm burying the past
Gonna have peace now, you can be free
No one here will make a sucker out of me
Fernando

"Han har "sjunk't." "
"Vad sägs? "
"Kalle Skändare kanhända!"
"Första plus...har du första eller andra plus? "

Varför sörjer du, Fernando?
Varför klingar din gitarr i moll, vad äar det som står på?
Är det kärleken, Fernando?
Har hon lämnat dej, din stora, stora kärlek, är det så?
Den som älskat och förlorat vet att sånt kan ändå hända då och då

Länge, länge leve kärleken
Vår bästa vän, Fernando
Fyll dit glas och höj en skål för den
För kärleken, Fernando
Spela, spela melodien och sjung. sången om lyckan
Länge, länge leve kärleken den kärleken, Fernando
Varför sörjer du, Fernando?
Varför klingar din gitarr i moll, vad äar det som står på?
Är det kärleken, Fernando?
Har hon lämnat dej, din stora, stora kärlek, är det så?
Den som älskat och förlorat

"Det där funkar ju jättebra. "
"Javisst det är ganska ballt så där också."
"Javisst är det det. "
Here Comes Rubie Jamie

Some people long for Berlin and Barcelona
They yearn for Paris, Madrid and Rome
And I know some who prefer Arizona
And some prefer home

There's only me who is dying to see...

"Ett! Är ni med då?! Ett-två-tre-fyra…"
"Jävla otäck situation."
Hamlet III, Parts 1 & 2
Part 1

Part 2

When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground
When the air gets cold then I think of us, of you and I
And it almost makes me cry
So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears and I fear my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake

Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees
The rain fell softly on your face
Oh, I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
The rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

"Det räcker där."
"Ja."
"Nu hör jag så alltså väldigt lite Frida!"
Free as a Bumble Bee

I'm down and I feel depressed
Sitting here just waiting for next bus travelling downtown
It's a crying shame, isn't it?
The beautiful weather
If I could have my way
Well, I would not be working
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be

As free as a bumble bee
Take a sip from every flower
Free as a bumble bee
While away each lazy hour

What a good life, lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life, living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw
Rubber Ball Man

The poster on the wall of a dear friend
I wish there was a way that I could show you
How your songs set me free
The hero of them all, you're a legend
I guess I'll never get a chance to know you
Still you're close as can be

Make the bandstand to a dreamland, rubber ball man
Clapping your hands, let your feet dance, rubber ball man
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still
Some of us dreaming, some of us screaming
Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man

Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man
Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man
Crying Over You

I'm waiting for you baby, I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you, it chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me, but now I know it's true
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you

I'm waiting for you baby, I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you, it chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me, but now I know it's true
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you

Crying over you
I'm crying over you
Crying over little memories of things we used to do
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you
Just Like That

Härligt!
Ett-två. Då kör vi då. Går bandet? Ett-två ett-två-tre...

Just like that
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart

Just like that
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes

But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone

Just like that
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

Giving a Little Bit More

There's a gentleness to everything you do
And it's rubbing off on me, I feel it too
I've been waiting, but my loneliness I get

When you call me on the phone
And I'm feeling so alone
When you ask me to come over, baby, you know I will
I could never stay on my own

Giving it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always giving a little more
When I'm with you
Giving it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always giving a little more

Ella se va tan feliz a la escuela ahora
Diciendo adiós con ausente sonreir
Allí se va y en mi siento una tristeza
Algo que me hace percibir

Aún me pertenece pero menos
En ese mundo de su candidez (Se me está escapando al crecer)
Feliz de compartir aún sa risa
Y toda su niñez

Se me está escapando al crecer
¿Cómo lograr que se detengan
Hoy los minutos?
Se me está escapando al crecer
Su gran fantasía cuidaré
Y cuando la voy descubriendo
Sigue creciendo
Se me está escapando ya lo sé

Hay en las dos ella y yo sueño al desayuno
Y, sin querer, dejo el tiempo transcurrir
Cuando se va siento en mí la melancolía
Cierta culpa que no sé fingir

¿Por dónde están aquellas aventuras?
¿Y los lugares que íbamos a ver? (Se me está escapando al crecer)
Algunas pocas cosas disfrutamos
Hay tanto por hacer

Se me está escapando al crecer
¿Cómo lograr que se detengan
Hoy los minutos?
Se me está escapando al crecer
Su gran fantasía cuidaré
Y cuando la voy descubriendo
Sigue creciendo
Se me está escapando ya lo sé

Si yo pudiera congelar la imagen
Guardar el tiempo y su capricho en mí
Se me está escapando


Se me está escapando ya lo se
Ella se va tan feliz a la escuela ahora

Suzy was nine and I was ten
Right at the time when boys like to think they're men
She used to follow us from school
We really thought that she was a little fool

And one day we said to her
"We don't wanna hurt you girl"
But you'd better

Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy-hang-around

Suzy went home to Mama's arms
Mama said "Look, she's never done you no harm
So get off her back and let her be
Why can't you play together in harmony?"

We really didn't know what to say
But as soon as she went away
We laughed and said

Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy-hang-around

Yes you'd better look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we'


Por los dos, brindo aquí, la cuenta se saldó
Lo que fué calidez, el frio invadió
Aves al pasar, tu y yo
Migramos con el sol
Hacia un verano nuevo sin oscuridad
Hoy que todo terminó, no hay a quien culpar

Somos dos, que ayer, vivimos soledad
Nuestra unión se quebró, con toda dignidad
Aún buscamos cielo azul
En nuestro caminar
Gracias por un gran amor y la felicidad
Hoy que todo terminó, no hay a quien culpar


Bien se da que al caer, hay posibilidad
De surgir otra vez y ver la realidad
Todo claro al final
No hay nada por probar
En el cruce del camino sólo un nuevo andar
Hoy que todo terminó, no hay a quien culpar

En el cruce del camino sólo un nuevo andar
Hoy que todo 


I saw it in the mirror, I saw it in my face
That I'm no longer needed, anyone can take my place
I saw it in the mirror when I look into my eyes
'Cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries
This boy cries

I saw it in the mirror, my head is hanging low
And I ain't too familiar with the feelings that I show
I know you say you love me, but I'm looking through your lies
It doesn't really bother you if this boy cries
This boy cries

I never thought I could cry for you
But honey, I will miss you till the day I die
Till the day I die

I saw it in the mirror, I saw it in my face
That I'm no longer needed, anyone can take my place
I saw it in the mirror when I look into my eyes
'Cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries



Se dice que el ansioso esconde un alma en paz
Viajero o misionero, va lejos mucho más
Si miro hasta el cielo, o dentro mío, no sé
Ya nada importa mucho
Si puedo, con sinceridad, saber que lo intenté

Como el mar y su creciente
Va la gente al andar
Como el viento y su corrida
Va la vida al andar
Como el sol a la mañana
Que reclama el andar
Atesoro el momento
Vivo y siento, es mi intento
Y lo hago al andar

Viajé por tantos lados en la imaginación
Estamos siempre andando, sin tiempo ni razón
¿Quién sabe las respuestas, quién puede elegir?
Si existen diferencias
Sabemos que hay, en cada ser, deseos de vivir

Como el mar y su creciente
Va la gente al andar
Como el viento y su corrida
Va la vida al andar
Como el sol a la mañana
Que reclama el andar
Atesoro el momento
Vivo y siento, es mi intento
Y lo hago al andar

La brisa que acaricia con suavidad el mar
Y todas las gaviotas que vuelan sin cesar
Lo veo y lo siento, y no lo sé explicar
Espléndido momento
Sentir llover, y el sol nacer
Vivir y disfrutar

Como el mar y su creciente
Va la gente al andar
Como el viento y su corrida
Va la vida al andar
Como el sol a la mañana
Que reclama el andar
Atesoro el momento
Vivo y siento, es mi intento
Y lo hago al andar

Como el viento y su corrida
Va la vida al andar
Como el sol a la mañana
Que reclama el andar
Atesoro el momento
Vivo y siento, es mi intento
Y lo hago al andar
Como el viento y su corrida
Va la vida al an


I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music for giving it to me

I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance

Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

So I say thank you for 


Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

"Ett, två... ett, två, tre..."

Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Like a diamond glittering in the sky
Seems to me you shine your light
Down to me to say goodnight
Twinkle twinkle, my old friend
Sleep is waiting round the bend
While you travel through the Milky Way
From afar
Twinkle twinkle twinkle little star
Another Morning Without You

Raindrops on a windowpane
Stillness of a summer rain
Silently the haze drifts through the trees
Slowly dawn is breaking through
Yet a morning without you
Curtains rustling in the breeze
I'm still trapped within my dreams
Daylight makes its way into my mind
Coming through
Yet another morning without you
An Angel Walked Through My Room

Finally when darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Mmm...
Echoes of a voice I knew
An Angel Passing Through My Room

Half awake and half in dreams (Half awake and half in dreams)
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room
An Angel's Passing Through My Room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room
Like an Angel Passing Through My Room

Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon

I have tried in vain never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost my only friend
Now it seems I have to start again

Merry-go-round where am I bound
With my love and feelings, merry-go-round?
Who wants to kiss me and hug me and miss me?
Yes, who wants to do it? I wish that I knew it
Merry-go-round, wish I had found
Somebody to care for, where am I bound?
Life is so lonely if life is just only
To love with my loving goes round and round

Looking for someone who would want to stay
I might find her with a bit of luck one day
But who knows so until then
I can only try and try again

Merry-go-round where am I bound
With my love and feelings, merry-go-round?
Who wants to kiss me and hug me and miss me?
Yes, who wants to do it? I wish that I knew it

I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
How I wish this road would take me home where I belong
'Cause I have found no other place where I will stay
I'm tired and all my dreams have failed along the way

I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
Though I wonder what my folks would think about me now
I guess I've changed, like people do, when things go wrong
But in the end, somehow I know, we'll get along

Santa Rosa, I'll be back to stay
I'm on my way
Santa Rosa, I'll be back to stay

I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
How I wish to see the old house where I used to live
And all my friends, will they be there, when I come home?
How I regret the day when I set out to roam

Santa Rosa, I'll be back to stay
I'm on my way
Santa Rosa, I'll be back to stay

I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
(I'd give anything to be back home)
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
(I'd give anything to be back home)
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa

Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories
Those were my happiest days

I remember all the games we used to play
I really do
And I went to see them almost every day
I wanted to
Though we quarreled at times
And had a few fights
We were the best of friends
We found a place in the sun
A heaven of fun

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Climbing the apple tree
Yes, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all me my memories
Those were my happiest days

They would take me out for football games and such
They liked to play
And I guess I didn't like it very much
But anyway
I was happy and proud
To be with the boys
Being a little girl
I found a place in the sun
A heaven of fun

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Climbing the apple tree
Yes, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all me my memories
Those were my happiest days

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place

Where I've got all my memories
Those were my happiest days
Got all my memories
Those were my happiest days
Where I've got all my memories
Those were my happiest days
Got all my memories
Those were my happiest days
Mmm, where I've got all my memo


Sitting in the darkest corner
In the tender light I saw her face
She was looking so sad and lonely
Someone help me, someone save me
I could see the look she gave me, oh
Oh yeah, and there was one thing only
That I knew I could do

Let's go, girl
It's a beautiful place this world
Come on, baby, let's dance

Let me show you that I know how

You'd been sitting there for hours
Trying to hide behind the flowers now
Baby, we could have fun together
Come on, cheer up, let's get started
No use being broken-hearted now
Oh yeah, you're gonna feel much better
Yes, I know that you will

Let's go, girl
It's a beautiful place this world
Come on, baby, let's dance
To the rock 'n' roll band

A sense of expectation hanging in the air

Until that day
My life had been a river following
A safe, predestinated course
Suddenly detouring so unexpectedly
With uncompromising force
My strongholds broke down all too easily
I remember well
How it did embarrass me
I hung on to his every smile
Marveled at his style

Just like that
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
He found a temporary home
In my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

And once again
The river's flowing slowly
Following its safe and uneventful course
Now the tears have dried
It's become a pleasant break
I recall without remorse
But now and then
I wonder where he is
And I will admit
He had something that I miss
I guess he was a rolling stone
The only one I've known

Just like that
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
He found a temporary home
In my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

Just like that
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no


Spójrz jak szybko minęły nam lata te
Sami nawet nie wiemy, kiedy i gdzie
Stoimy tu, wokół ludzi tłum
Pytacie nas: „skąd ten smutny szum bierze się?”
Dziś pożegnać się nadszedł czas
Jeszcze jedną chwilę, a może dwie
I już tak jak dziś nie spotkamy się
Oooo...

Mamma mia, dziś jesteśmy tu
Tak, tak, po raz już ostatni
Mamma mia, czy wrócimy znów
Do tych wszystkich twarzy bratnich?
Tak, mamy serca płaczące
Choć usta są śpiewające
Bye, bye, tak musimy odejść stąd
Mamma mia, teraz wiemy to
Że to był ostatni w szkole rok

Czasem byliśmy fajni, a czasem nie
Czasem też się zdarzało, że było źle
Lecz kiedy znów wrzesień będzie już
Wspomnijcie nas i zetrzyjcie z pamięci kurz
Bo to czeka każdego z was
Na każdego ucznia przychodzi czas
Dzisiaj żegnasz się ty, a jutro ja
Oooo...

Mamma mia, dziś jesteśmy tu
Tak, tak, po raz już ostatni
Mamma mia, czy wrócimy znów
Do tych wszystkich twarzy bratnich?
Tak, mamy serca płaczące
Choć usta są śpiewające
Bye, bye, tak musimy odejść stąd

Mamma mia, dziś jesteśmy tu
Tak, tak, po raz już ostatni
Mamma mia, czy wrócimy znów
Do tych wszystkich twarzy bratnich?
Mamma mia, dziś jesteśmy tu
Tak, tak, po raz już ostatni
Mamma mia, czy wrócimy znów
Do tych wszystkich twarzy bratnich?

Tak, mamy serca płaczące
Choć usta są śpiewające
Bye, bye, tak musimy odejść stąd
Mamma mia, teraz wiemy to



El teléfono está allí
Y no suena para mí
Pienso, "¿Qué pasó y dónde estarás que no llamas?"
Es la noche triste y gris
No me siento muy feliz
Y mi amor, ¿qué hago?; yo estoy aquí esperando

Que me llames y por fin
¡Cambia el mundo para mí! Oh

¡Ring, ring, llámame al fin, por favor!
¡Ring, ring, es la más bella canción!
¡Ring, ring, la guardo con emoción!
Y estoy junto al teléfono
¡Sin moverme, estoy mirándolo!
¡Oh, ring, ring, llámame al fin, por favor!
¡Oh, ring, ring, llámame al fin, por favor!

Yo te tuve y te perdí
Pero no lo comprendí
Me equivoqué, pero jamás podré saber cómo ha sido
¿Cuánto hará que no me ves?
¿Es un año? ¿Es un mes?
Si llorando estoy, comprende que yo sufra en silencio

Necesito tu perdón
¡Escucha a mi corazón! Oh

¡Ring, ring, llámame al fin, por favor!
¡Ring, ring, es la más bella canción!
¡Ring, ring, la guardo con emoción!
Y estoy junto al teléfono
¡Sin moverme, estoy mirándolo!
¡Oh, ring, ring, llámame al fin, por favor!
¡Oh, ring, ring, llámame al fin, por favor!

¡Oh, ring, ring, llámame al fin, por favor!
¡Oh, ring, ring, llámame al fin, por favor!
¡Oh, ring, ring, llámame al fin, por favor!

Ich bin ganz allein zu haus
Sowas hält doch keiner aus
Deine Eifersucht, die ist doch blöd und albern und dumm nur!
Baby, treib es nicht zu weit
Immer wieder machst du Streit
Kannst du mir mal sagen, du, wieso, weshalb und warum nur?

Auch bei mir reißt mal der Draht
Häng dich an den Apparat, oh

Ring, ring, vierzehn-null-sieben-null-drei

Geh doch endlich mal ran ans Telefon

Oh, ring, ring, vierzehn-null-sieben-null-drei
Oh, ring, ring sonst ist es aus und vorbei

Sag mir nicht, dir fehlt die Zeit
Oder die Gelegenheit
Denn es gibt hier doch an jeder Straßenecke eine Zelle
Sag mir nicht, daß es nicht paßt
Weil du keine Groschen hast
Denn in jeder Post in jeder Bank ist eine Wechselstelle

Auch bei mir reißt mal der Draht

I'm down and I feel depressed
Sitting here, just waiting
For next bus travelling downtown
It's a crying shame, isn't it?

The beautiful weather
If I could have my way
Well, I would not be working
On a day like this, I know what I'd like to be

As free as a bumble bee
Take a sip from every flower
Free as a bumble bee
While away each lazy hour

What a good life, lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life, living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

Åh, vilka tider
Paradiset hägrar
Du får kalla det fantasier
Men nog är det en dröm man minns

Drömde en dröm, jag minns och jag känner
Vatten blev vin och fiender vänner
Mmm, det var härligt att leva
Allting var fritt så vem skulle sakna någonting då
Nej, paradis
Nakna var vi som Adam och Eva

Åh, vilka tider
Underbara dagar
Roa sig kungligt, må som en prins
Njuta allt gott som finns
Åh, vilka tider
Paradiset hägrar
Du får kalla det fantasier
Men nog är det en dröm man minns

V ingen var sur och ingen var dyster
Var och en var en bror och en syster
Åh, vad jag drömde den stunden
Skatan, hon gol och göken, han skratta'
Ingenting var som det, kan du fatta
Vi var i paradislunden

Åh, vilka tider
Underbara dagar
Roa sig kungligt, må som en prins
Njuta allt gott som finns
Åh, vilka tider
Paradiset hägrar
Du får kalla det fantasier
Men nog är det en dröm man minns
Du får kalla det fantasier

Ja, och om ni vill se oss i tv, så ska vi deltaga i eurovisionsslagerprogrammet och den låten kommer nog också och ingå i showen. det ska bli skönt och komma ut på folkparksscenerna igen, eller hur

Ja! Javisst!

Du und ich hatten uns're Zeit
Ist es nun am Ende doch soweit?
Kann es wirklich möglich sein?
Unser Himmel war wolkenlos
War das alles eine Täuschung bloß?
Und du läßt mich nun allein
Und nun stürzt der Himmel ein

Wer im Wartesaal der Liebe steht
Weiß, daß es um alles geht
Und man fragt sich nur wie wird das noch enden
Wer im wartesaal der Liebe steht
Hofft es ist noch nicht zu spät
Alles wird sich vielleicht zum Guten wenden
Alles wird sich vielleicht zum Guten wenden

War das etwa die Endstation
Und ich merkte einfach nichts davon
Hab' ich mich denn so geirrt?
Was zu tun war hab ich getan
Jetzt kommt es auf and're Dinge an
Niemand weiß, was mit uns wird
Wohin der Weg uns führt

Wer im Wartesaal der Liebe steht
Weiß, daß es um alles geht
Und man fragt sich nur wie wird das noch enden

They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell

They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything

There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas

I was at a party and this fella said to me
"Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights"

I said, "Who are you to talk about impending doom?"
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, "I'm a minister, a big shot in the state"
I said, "I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?"
He said, "Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone"

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone

Over in the corner I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, "Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?"
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, "If you're going somewhere can I come along?"
I said, "Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone"

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone

Standing up is scary if you think you're gonna fall
Like a Humpty-Dumpty 'fraid of falling off your wall
I say if you ever wanna know what's going on
Gotta keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone


On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone

Från Hova kom
Det en bonnläpp. Det svängde om
Släpa och slet och snodde
Och sen så småningom
På dur och moll
Blev han rikare än ett troll
Nu är hans dagar fyllda
Utav tunga beslut
Lukas ska ut
Baken ska saltas
Korven ska kokas
Lukas ska ut

Knarllarnas röst
Västergötlands stämma på Jorden
Sångar hjärta klappar i ditt bröst
Pennan glöder. Upp flyga orden
Raska klackar slå ännu
Som ett jehu är du
Hovas vittne ger alrig upp
Hovas vittne
Full fart framåt. Flaggan i topp
Hos dig på fest
När man sitter och trivs som mest
Hör man någonting som surrar
En dammsugare protest
Från den Parnasse
Tar du flyget is första klass
Djurgården-Honolulu
Om du komma fram
Englit program
Med ditt bagage i Rom
Och Gudrun i Amsterdam

Knarllarnas röst
Västergötlands stämma på Jorden

Vi och du är långhalm och ler
Full fart bakåt
Hovas vittne, vad som än sker
Stikke-Stikkan
Det är befogat denna gång
Trots att du tycker en låten
Blir for lång
Stikke-Stikkan
Det har vi skrivit i den tron
Att du blir glad om vi höjer
En halvton

Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad
And I've always been under your heel
Holy Christ‚ what a lousy deal
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways
And I ain't gonna take it no more
Oh no no‚ walkin' out that door

Burning my bridges‚ cutting my ties
Once again I wanna look into the eye
Being myself, counting my pride
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride
Burning my bridges, moving at last
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past
Gonna have peace now‚ you can be free
No one here will make a sucker out of me

Tyst och död är telefon
Står där nästan som ett hån
Inte ringer du och säger "Älsklig" nu som du gjorde
Allting är så tyst mot förr
Ingen knackar på min dörr
Det som lockat mig frestar inte, nej, som det borde

Inget roar mig just nu
Ingen annan bara du, åh

¡Ring, ring, lámame al fin, por favor!
¡Ring, ring, es la más bella canción!
¡Ring, ring, la guardo con emoción!

Om du ring, ring, ringde en endaste gång
Om du ring, ring, ringde en endaste gång

Om du ring, ring, ringde en endaste gång
Om du ring, ring, ringde en endaste gång

Déjà - à Waterloo Napoléon a dû se rendre
Et moi - je crois que mon destin prend aujourd'hui le même chemin

Les livres d’histoire et la vie
Racontent la même comédie

Waterloo, tu es vainqueur et je perds la guerre
Waterloo, je me constitue ta prisionière
Waterloo, je ne peux plus fuir et plus t'échapper
Waterloo, pour la vie je promets de t'aimer
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Il est arrivé mon Waterloo

Jo, jo - man värjer sig och fäktas i det längsta
Men, men - mot känslor kämpar gudarna förgäves har man sagt

Det är som jag hörde en sång
Jag tror det är kärlek på gång

Waterloo, så har man funnit sin överman
Waterloo, mäktig och väldig och stark är han
Waterloo, allting känns rätt, och det är min tro
Waterloo, du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo

Det är som jag hörde en sång
Jag tror det är kärlek på gång

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Baby, baby, you're out of sight
Hey, you're looking alright tonight
When you come to the party
Listen to the guys
They got that look in their eyes
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene

My, my - at Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah - oh, yeah! - and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

My, my - I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh, yeah - oh, yeah! - and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore

I am a young man with a simple occupation
I clean the toilets at a local railway station
There's no romance in my life
Sometimes I wish I had a knife
I read the offers on the advertisement pages
The cries for help from different people, different ages
But they have nothing to say
At least not until today
When something special I read
This is what it said:

"If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
It’s a bargain if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
It's a bargain if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one"

I called the number and a voice said, "Alice Lexie"
The voice was husky and it sounded kinda sexy
I was amazed at my luck
The purest streak of gold I'd struck
I said, "I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don’t we meet for a chat?
The three of us in my flat
I can't forget what you said"
This is what I read:

"If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
It's a bargain if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
It's a bargain if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one"

I am a young man with a simple occupation
I clean the platform and the toil


I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight


And I feel so good, and I feel so right
And I know that you must have a lovelight

You've got lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You've got lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don


He stands towering over me beside my bed losing his head
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on the usual way he's such a clever guy
And I wonder should I laugh or cry
He's dressed in the striped pajamas that I bought trousers too short
Gives me all his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does and me I get so tired
And I wonder should I laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies a fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size
All I see is the big balloon halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie so should I laugh or cry
Strange how dangerously indifferent I have grown cold as a stone
No more pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on, I feel my throat go dry
And I wonder should I laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies a fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size
All I see is the big balloon halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eterna


Vi skriver lördagskväll
Och tivedsflikan säll
Har vandrat ut från mörka skogen
Åt alla hörn och håll
Det gått som en paroll
På lördag är det dans på logen
Och med en tacksam smäll
Att det är lördagskväll
Slår kolaren igen sin koja
För när som det är dans
I trakten någonstans
Då vill han vara med och skoja
Där vi i skog och dal
Sällan skådar kvinnlig fägring
Där uti kojan sval
Hamo låter som en hägring
Mennu uti vi chansen har
Att å minnen med tillbaka
Bra att ad vid långa gråa dar
Som tröst för det vi får försaka
Hör raska klackar slår
När tivedshambo går
Har Fridas Verner blivit galen
Här sprätter tivedsbor
I hambodansens klor
Och Verner jagar landsfiskalen
Jag blir det gräl och kiv
Så avgörs det med kniv
För här är rena Vilda Västern
Till vardag och till fest
Är rapesnuset bäst
Kom hit så bär vi bort orkestern
Kvinnor, vin öch sång
Vi slåss på samma gång
Och river sönder våra kläder
Och har man inga kvar
Man år med rumpan bar
Och tror på fortsatt vackert väder
Vi kastar inte pil
Vi har en anna stil
Som mera lutar åt det vilda
Jag her väl ändå rätt
Att slåss på min biljett
När dom ger ögonkast åt Hilda
Då kan det hända att
Tivedsblodet svallar över
Då åker rock hatt
Utifall ni stryk behöver
Vana vid släp och slit
Kojarliv och tivedskogar
Står vårt mod och våran fasta lit
Till styrkan och till våra knogar
Hör raska klackar slår
När tivedshambo går
Har Fridas Verner blivit galen
Här sprätter tivedsbor
I hambodansens klor
Och Verner jagar landsfiskalen
Jag blir det gräl och kiv
Så avgörs det med kniv
För här är rena Vilda Västern
Till vardag och till fest
Är rapesnuset bäst
