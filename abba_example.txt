I wanna talk to you all about this
You look so young
And for the first time someone's gonna look at you funny

Oh, how it makes me feel
So sad, I've had that look in my eye
It says I'm gonna lose it if you're not
I wanna talk to you all about it
You look so young
And for the first time someone's gonna look at you funny
Oh, how it makes a man feel


We've learned to live without love
So what now? We just have to face the fact
Love is dead, baby
It comes by other means
And nothing more I can do about it
Love has left town
It's gone and now the only thing I can do
Is wait until the next train

Love is dead, baby
We've learned to live without love
So what now? We just have to face the fact
Love is dead
Love comes by other means
But what do we do?
'Cause what does love have to do with the pain in our hearts
Love leaves no place for us
It's out with another
And when the next bell rings
What do we do?
'Cause what does love have to do with the pain we will endure
Love leaves no place for us
What's good, what's wise, what's true
For when love is gone
We just have to face the fact
Love is dead,
